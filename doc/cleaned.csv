CollinRugg,2023-08-29 23:48:42+00:00,"JUST IN: Hunter Biden helped coordinate a plan to shut down Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin's investigation into Burisma. After Shokin launched new investigations into Burisma, the gas company turned to Hunter for help. Hunter then linked Burisma up with former Clinton administration officials who would work on behalf of Burisma to ""close down for any cases/pursuits against [Burisma owner Zlochevsky] in Ukraine."" The ex-Clinton officials, who operated as a Washington DC consultancy company named Blue Star Strategies, were then hired by Burisma in late 2015. Their job was to lobby State Department officials to protect Burisma. The chain of events line up with Congressional testimony where Archer claimed Hunter Biden called Joe Biden to intervene in Shokin's investigation. ""I think they were getting pressure and they requested Hunter help them with some of that pressure,"" Archer said. ""The request is like, 'Can DC help? There weren't specific, you know, 'Can the Big Guy help?' It was always this amorphous, 'Can we get help in DC?'"" By the time March of 2016 rolled around, Joe Biden threatened to withhold $1B unless Ukraine fired Shokin... which they followed through with. So...

If it wasn't for MI City Clerk Ann Meisch who caught the woman dropping off these ballots, they would have likely been added to the state's voter rolls. Just imagine how many voter registrations were not caught in swing states... On Friday, Detroit News confirmed @gatewaypundit's reporting on the development. A redacted police report describes how Meisch encountered a woman dropping off 8,000 - 10,000 completed voter registration applications. The @gatewaypundit reported that the “registrations included the same handwriting, non-existent addresses, and incorrect phone numbers.” An investigation found that the woman worked for GBI Strategies. GBI Strategies was funded by dark money super PAC ‘BlackPAC,’ who paid them $11,254,919 to register voters for Joe Biden. Upon further investigation, the police found guns, burner phones, pre-paid cash cards and incomplete registrations at a defunct eyeglass store where GBI Strategies had set up operation. There was plenty of fraud in the 2020 election. The problem was that people in positions of power didn't want to find it.

The comments came when the pair was discussing how a $3M payment was made from China to Biden business partner Rob Walker. Cruz: ""So the Chinese Communist government was sending the money?"" Comer: ""Yes... If Hunter Biden was doing something legitimate for China, they could have just wired the money to Hunter Biden, but they didn't."" ""They sent it to a company called Robinson Walker. Then they wired it to a company called Owasco. Then they wired it to another company called Bohai. These companies don't do anything with the money.""
