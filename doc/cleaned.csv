The ex-Clinton officials, who operated as a Washington DC consultancy company named Blue Star Strategies, were then hired by Burisma in late 2015.

A redacted police report claims that Muskegon, MI City Clerk Ann Meisch encountered a woman dropping off 8,000 - 10,000 completed voter registration applications. As detailed by @gatewaypundit, the “registrations included the same handwriting, non-existent addresses, and incorrect phone numbers.” An investigation found that the woman worked for GBI Strategies. As noted by @KanekoaTheGreat, dark money super PAC ‘BlackPAC’ paid GBI Strategies $11,254,919 to register voters for Joe Biden. The police then searched the office of GBI where they found “semiautomatic guns, silencers/suppressors, burner phones, a bag of pre-paid cash cards, and incomplete registrations, in an office space that was styled as an eyeglasses store that had gone defunct.” No arrests were made. While speaking with Steve Bannon, Kloster recalled the events and claimed “there were standing orders not to deal with election matters.” “There were standing orders not to deal with election matters, both from the White House Council and from Barr. I happened to know Barr’s Chief of Staff, Will Levi, because I had worked at Heritage and ran into him at a lunch basically for Senate staffers.” “I called him up and tried to put the flag up into the voting rights section, CRD-DOJ and White House Counsel in a couple different places and got stiff-armed.

CollinRugg,2023-07-18 00:43:07+00:00,"JUST IN: The FBI tipped off the Biden team to help Hunter Biden evade punishment from the criminal investigation into his finances according to a former FBI supervisory agent. Instead of approaching Hunter Biden like the FBI would do with any other person under investigation, agents were told to *not* approach Hunter and instead wait for his call. Conveniently, Hunter Biden never called meaning he was never interviewed. In an interview with the @GOPoversight, the former agent said he has never been told to ""wait outside to be contacted by the subject of an investigation."" While being questioned last week, Rep. Matt Gaetz asked FBI director Wray why he was so ""uncurious"" about getting to the bottom of Hunter Biden's crimes. Wray is more than just ""uncurious."" He is an active working asset of the Biden family to protect them from facing punishment.

CollinRugg,2023-07-17 21:32:57+00:00,"NEW: Hunter Biden witness Devon Archer is set to testify to the House Oversight Committee next week about corruption he witnessed involving the Biden crime family. I'm sure FBI director Chris Wray won't be watching. Archer is supposedly going to be discussing Hunter Biden's shady business dealings in Russia and Ukraine as well as the alleged $10 million bribe the Biden family took from Ukraine. Archer worked very closely with Hunter Biden on Burisma's board and also met with then-VP Joe Biden at the White House around the time he and Hunter joined Burisma. Archer was also involved with Hunter's work with Russian oligarchs, including Yelena Baturina, the former first lady of Moscow. As noted by @JustTheNews, Archer ""knows how and why Hunter Biden landed on the Burisma board and was courted by oligarchs from Russia to China... knows well the labyrinth of companies through which Hunter Biden moved and took money.""
