Donald Trump is only being arrested because he is the political opponent of the current regime in power. These are the tactics used in Franco’s Spain, Hitler’s Germany and Mussolini’s Italy. The fascism has never gone away but the propaganda has gotten better and better. This has been years in the making. The Left took over the mainstream education system to begin to indoctrinate their ideas into the youth. They selectively taught history and created ambivalence to the very fascism they wanted to enact. The Left took over the mainstream media and began to program the masses to not be able to know the truth. They have programmed the common man and woman who do not think to do independent research to hate all things conservative and all things Republican. The Left took over the justice system little by little. It started in local offices. It started slowly but was done methodically and effectively. Then Soros-types dumped millions into prosecutors all around this country in a very explicit manner to not be secret anymore and brag they can do whatever they want. So many people have just woken up today and asked where their country went. Their country disappeared a very long time ago, they just didn’t announce it. The masters of propaganda have always wanted you to think things are just fine and as they always were. They were never going to announce for you that they were taking away your country, that would be too obvious. Now it is time for people to wake up and understand the nation they once knew and loved no longer exists. It exists in name only but in principle it has been overtaken by a shadow government who was not even legitimately elected. The time to be scared is now because they are no longer interested in hiding how corrupt they’ve become. They are happy to perp walk a former President who did nothing wrong simply so that they can let everyone know this is THEIR country now and you have no place here. This is so sad for the rest of the world because the greatest and freest Republic that was ever known has fallen to the same fascism that took down so many world powers before. The rest of the world can no longer look to America as a nation that is the shining city on the hill but can only know it as another failed state who will attack anyone who opposes the regime. May God have mercy on the lost souls who are supporting this fascism because they do not realize it one day will come for them as well. Only those who are in power benefit in a society like this. The rest will be peasants and are expendable to those in power.
