In response, China’s state-run newspaper has stated that the U.S. has crossed a red line with “lethal consequences.” We are badly screwing up our posture & it doesn’t have to be this way. Right now the U.S. embraces the “One China” Policy, which fails to recognize Taiwan as a nation & adopts “strategic ambiguity” about whether or not the U.S. will defend Taiwan against invasion. This creates mutual confusion with China about red lines & increases the risk of major conflict between the U.S. and China, especially heightened in the near-term when the entire U.S. economy and modern way of life relies on leading-edge semiconductors manufactured in Taiwan. It is a vital U.S. national security interest to ensure that China *does not* acquire sole control of the global semiconductor supply chain, so the U.S. should shift from strategic ambiguity to strategic clarity: commit to affirmatively *defend Taiwan against Chinese annexation until the U.S. achieves semiconductor independence*, at which point the U.S. should resume its current posture of strategic ambiguity. In the meantime, Taiwan can double its own military expenditures to a more rational 4-5% of GDP while the U.S. bolsters its own military and economic alliances with India, Japan, and South Korea and fortifies our own homeland defense capabilities – including but not limited to nuclear missile, super-EMP, and cyber defenses.

By joining together, workers have a greater bargaining power than they would individually. - Improved Job Security: Unions can help protect workers from layoffs or unjust termination by negotiating job security provisions in collective bargaining agreements. - Improved Compensation: Unions can negotiate for higher wages, overtime pay, and benefits like health insurance, retirement plans, and paid time off. - Workplace Safety: Unions can help improve workplace safety by negotiating for better safety equipment, training, and procedures. - Training and Professional Development: Unions can help their members access training and professional development opportunities to improve their skills and advance their careers. - Advocacy: Unions can advocate for workers' rights and represent them in disputes with employers, including grievances and legal actions. - Political Power: Unions can use their collective power to influence public policy and elect politicians who support workers' rights. Overall, unions can help workers achieve greater economic security, better working conditions, and a stronger voice in the workplace and the broader society. #SolidaritySummer",happy fact union member
