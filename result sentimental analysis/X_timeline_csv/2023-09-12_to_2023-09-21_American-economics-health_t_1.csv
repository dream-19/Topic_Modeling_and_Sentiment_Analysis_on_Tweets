The impact of this tax cut was huge. Families facing rising prices used the tax cut to help pay for gas, groceries, childcare, and medicine. And Census Bureau data found that, thanks to this tax cut, the child poverty rate in America was cut in half, to a record low. But because Congress was one vote short of renewing the expanded credit, it expired. Now, new Census Bureau data has confirmed the expected and shameful result: child poverty more than doubled in the past year, up almost 140 percent. This is a moral obscenity. The richest nation in the world shouldn’t tolerate our children living in poverty. And our experience with the Child Tax Credit proves that we don’t have to. Poverty is a policy choice.

The MAGAnomics Budget calls for $5.1 trillion in tax cuts skewed to the wealthy and big corporations. Under their plan, the top 1% —households making more than $4 million per year—would get tax cuts averaging at least $175,000 per year. That’s more than 2 times a typical American family’s entire annual income. On top of that, the most profitable corporations would no longer have to pay the minimum tax the President signed into law. • Cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and Other Vital Programs. How do House Republicans square their lavish tax giveaways for the wealthy with their stated commitment to reducing the deficit? By making trillions of dollars of cuts to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs seniors and working families count on. The MAGAnomics Budget would increase the Social Security retirement age to 69, restrict eligibility for Social Security Disability Insurance and slash disability benefits, and raise Medicare premiums for many seniors. Republicans want to further cut Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act, and the Children’s Health Insurance Program more than in half, which could result in tens of millions of people losing their health insurance, while repealing protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions. • Raise Costs for Hardworking Families. The MAGAnomics Budget does the bidding of Big Pharma by raising prescription drug costs by eliminating Medicare’s ability to negotiate prices, eliminating the $35 per month cap on insulin costs for Medicare beneficiaries, and eliminating the requirement that drug companies pay rebates to Medicare when they raise prices faster than inflation. It repeals the Inflation Reduction Act’s expansion of premium tax credits, driving up health insurance premiums by an average of $800 for nearly 15 million people. It raises taxes by thousands of dollars on middle class families who purchase electric vehicles or install heat pumps. It slashes Pell Grants by at least $1,000 for millions of students while eliminating eligibility for hundreds of thousands of students from moderate-income families. The list goes on and on. #Bidenomics, which has already fueled record investment in manufacturing and jobs includes proposals to make the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share while cutting taxes for working families; protect and strengthen Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid; and reduce the deficit by an additional $2.5 trillion over 10 years. Fiscally irresponsible Republicans continue their deficit-expanding attacks on the middle class and are quietly advancing a package of massive tax cuts for big corporations—including proposals that would funnel large giveaways to private equity firms and pushing legislation to ensure U.S. multinational companies can continue cutting their tax rates by shifting jobs overseas and sheltering income in tax havens around the world.

The MAGAnomics Budget calls for $5.1 trillion in tax cuts skewed to the wealthy and big corporations. Under their plan, the top 1% —households making more than $4 million per year—would get tax cuts averaging at least $175,000 per year. That’s more than 2 times a typical American family’s entire annual income. On top of that, the most profitable corporations would no longer have to pay the minimum tax the President signed into law. • Cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and Other Vital Programs. How do House Republicans square their lavish tax giveaways for the wealthy with their stated commitment to reducing the deficit? By making trillions of dollars of cuts to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs seniors and working families count on. The MAGAnomics Budget would increase the Social Security retirement age to 69, restrict eligibility for Social Security Disability Insurance and slash disability benefits, and raise Medicare premiums for many seniors. Republicans want to further cut Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act, and the Children’s Health Insurance Program more than in half, which could result in tens of millions of people losing their health insurance, while repealing protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions. • Raise Costs for Hardworking Families. The MAGAnomics Budget does the bidding of Big Pharma by raising prescription drug costs by eliminating Medicare’s ability to negotiate prices, eliminating the $35 per month cap on insulin costs for Medicare beneficiaries, and eliminating the requirement that drug companies pay rebates to Medicare when they raise prices faster than inflation. It repeals the Inflation Reduction Act’s expansion of premium tax credits, driving up health insurance premiums by an average of $800 for nearly 15 million people. It raises taxes by thousands of dollars on middle class families who purchase electric vehicles or install heat pumps. It slashes Pell Grants by at least $1,000 for millions of students while eliminating eligibility for hundreds of thousands of students from moderate-income families. The list goes on and on. #Bidenomics, which has already fueled record investment in manufacturing and jobs includes proposals to make the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share while cutting taxes for working families; protect and strengthen Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid; and reduce the deficit by an additional $2.5 trillion over 10 years. Fiscally irresponsible Republicans continue their deficit-expanding attacks on the middle class and are quietly advancing a package of massive tax cuts for big corporations—including proposals that would funnel large giveaways to private equity firms and pushing legislation to ensure U.S. multinational companies can continue cutting their tax rates by shifting jobs overseas and sheltering income in tax havens around the world.

Here are the details. Please share them with everyone you know! The #MAGATaxScam is the most recent attempt by Republicans to push their FAILED trickle-down philosophy on all of us to benefit their wealthy donors. Their plan would: ▪️ Give $5.1 trillion in tax cuts skewed to the wealthy and big corporations. (The top 0.1 percent - households making more than $4 million per year - would get tax cuts averaging at least $175,000 per year.) ▪️ Eliminate the requirement that the most profitable companies pay the corporate minimum tax the President signed into law. ▪️ Make trillions of dollars of cuts to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs seniors and working families count on to pay for their 1% tax cuts. ▪️ Increase the Social Security retirement age to 69. ▪️ Restrict eligibility for Social Security Disability Insurance, slash disability benefits, and raise Medicare premiums for many seniors. ▪️ Cut Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act, and the Children’s Health Insurance Program by more than 50%, which could result in tens of millions of people losing their health insurance, while repealing protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions. ▪️ Raise prescription drug costs by eliminating Medicare’s ability to negotiate prices, eliminating the $35 per month cap on insulin costs for Medicare beneficiaries, and eliminating the requirement that drug companies pay rebates to Medicare when they raise prices faster than inflation. ▪️ Slash Pell Grants by at least $1,000 for millions of students while eliminating eligibility for hundreds of thousands of students from moderate-income families.
