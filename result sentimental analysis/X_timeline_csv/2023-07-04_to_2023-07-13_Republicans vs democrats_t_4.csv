According to Republican Rep. Pat Fallon, the Biden White House is refusing to hand over information relating to finger prints on the bag of cocaine. “If the cocaine was found on a bag, doesn't it have fingerprints on it? And how long would it take to answer that question? Weeks, days, hours?” Rep Fallon: “I asked Texas Rangers and Sheriffs… they all said to me that on very porous surfaces like bags and envelopes, you'll be able to determine within an hour if there's fingerprints on it… we're 192 hours from the time it was discovered.” “And yet we don't know because if there was no fingerprints, they could have told us immediately.” “So I suspect there are fingerprints and you can run it through a database... So they very well may already know who it belongs to and aren't sharing with us.” Where’s Hunter??",biden white house appears engaged cover cocaine found white house hunter bidens recent visit according republican rep pat fallon biden white house refusing hand information relating finger print bag cocaine cocaine found bag fingerprint long answer question week day hour rep fallon asked texas ranger sheriff said porous surface like bag envelope able determine hour fingerprint hour time discovered know fingerprint told immediately suspect fingerprint run database know belongs sharing hunter,"[('hour', [4, 6]), ('biden', [4, 6]), ('know', [4, 7]), ('week', [4, 7]), ('said', [4, 7]), ('long', [4, 7]), ('according', [4, 6]), ('asked', [4]), ('hand', [4, 6]), ('house', [4, 7]), ('relating', [4]), ('rep', [4, 6]), ('day', [4, 7]), ('like', [4, 6]), ('question', [4, 6]), ('able', [4, 7]), ('hunter', [4]), ('sharing', [4, 6]), ('time', [4, 7]), ('immediately', [4, 7]), ('republican', [4, 7]), ('told', [4, 7]), ('bidens', [4]), ('texas', [4, 7]), ('white', [4, 7]), ('run', [4, 6]), ('appears', [4, 6]), ('information', [4, 6]), ('recent', [4, 7]), ('answer', [4, 6]), ('found', [4, 6]), ('pat', [3]), ('sheriff', [4]), ('refusing', [4]), ('cover', [4]), ('engaged', [4]), ('determine', [4, 7]), ('ranger', [3]), ('visit', [4, 6]), ('bag', [4]), ('suspect', [7, 6]), ('cocaine', [4]), ('belongs', [4, 7]), ('database', [6]), ('discovered', [7]), ('envelope', [7]), ('fallon', [7]), ('finger', [4]), ('fingerprint', [7]), ('porous', [7]), ('print', [3]), ('surface', [4])]","[('hour', ['Republicans vs democrats', 'Election/debate']), ('biden', ['Republicans vs democrats', 'Election/debate']), ('know', ['Republicans vs democrats', 'Abortion/rights/guns']), ('week', ['Republicans vs democrats', 'Abortion/rights/guns']), ('said', ['Republicans vs democrats', 'Abortion/rights/guns']), ('long', ['Republicans vs democrats', 'Abortion/rights/guns']), ('according', ['Republicans vs democrats', 'Election/debate']), ('asked', ['Republicans vs democrats']), ('hand', ['Republicans vs democrats', 'Election/debate']), ('house', ['Republicans vs democrats', 'Abortion/rights/guns']), ('relating', ['Republicans vs democrats']), ('rep', ['Republicans vs democrats', 'Election/debate']), ('day', ['Republicans vs democrats', 'Abortion/rights/guns']), ('like', ['Republicans vs democrats', 'Election/debate']), ('question', ['Republicans vs democrats', 'Election/debate']), ('able', ['Republicans vs democrats', 'Abortion/rights/guns']), ('hunter', ['Republicans vs democrats']), ('sharing', ['Republicans vs democrats', 'Election/debate']), ('time', ['Republicans vs democrats', 'Abortion/rights/guns']), ('immediately', ['Republicans vs democrats', 'Abortion/rights/guns']), ('republican', ['Republicans vs democrats', 'Abortion/rights/guns']), ('told', ['Republicans vs democrats', 'Abortion/rights/guns']), ('bidens', ['Republicans vs democrats']), ('texas', ['Republicans vs democrats', 'Abortion/rights/guns']), ('white', ['Republicans vs democrats', 'Abortion/rights/guns']), ('run', ['Republicans vs democrats', 'Election/debate']), ('appears', ['Republicans vs democrats', 'Election/debate']), ('information', ['Republicans vs democrats', 'Election/debate']), ('recent', ['Republicans vs democrats', 'Abortion/rights/guns']), ('answer', ['Republicans vs democrats', 'Election/debate']), ('found', ['Republicans vs democrats', 'Election/debate']), ('pat', ['News/radio/livestream']), ('sheriff', ['Republicans vs democrats']), ('refusing', ['Republicans vs democrats']), ('cover', ['Republicans vs democrats']), ('engaged', ['Republicans vs democrats']), ('determine', ['Republicans vs democrats', 'Abortion/rights/guns']), ('ranger', ['News/radio/livestream']), ('visit', ['Republicans vs democrats', 'Election/debate']), ('bag', ['Republicans vs democrats']), ('suspect', ['Abortion/rights/guns', 'Election/debate']), ('cocaine', ['Republicans vs democrats']), ('belongs', ['Republicans vs democrats', 'Abortion/rights/guns']), ('database', ['Election/debate']), ('discovered', ['Abortion/rights/guns']), ('envelope', ['Abortion/rights/guns']), ('fallon', ['Abortion/rights/guns']), ('finger', ['Republicans vs democrats']), ('fingerprint', ['Abortion/rights/guns']), ('porous', ['Abortion/rights/guns']), ('print', ['News/radio/livestream']), ('surface', ['Republicans vs democrats'])]"
