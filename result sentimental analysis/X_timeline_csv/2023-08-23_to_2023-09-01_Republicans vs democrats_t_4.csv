Now, many families whose loved ones have been killed in LA, whose cases aren’t in the media, are asking “what about my child’s case?” When Gascón took office, he promised to stop filing special circumstances on ALL cases no matter what. Special circumstances are aggravated forms of murder like torturing a child to death, murdering an innocent person because of her race or religion, killing a police officer, molesting or raping a child or adult & then murdering her, or a serial murderer. If convicted, the sentence is Life Without the Possibility of Parole (LWOP) or capital punishment. Gascón said a person who intentionally tortures & murders a child “evolves” & should be released from custody at some point. Without collaborating with victim’s families, DDA’s or law enforcement, or even looking at the evidence in a case, on day 1, Gascón ordered all special circumstances on pre-existing cases to be removed & disallowed the filing of special circumstances on any new cases. Gascón said he had a “mandate from the public,” even though the last time Californians voted on adding special circumstances in 2000, 72.5% (5 million people) voted for it. This blanket (no exception) policy lasted for almost 2 yrs until media pressure caused Gascón to flip-flop & now he’s making exceptions. Many cases, including the torture & murder of Anthony Avalos, Gascón didn’t make an exception. In Anthony’s case, I just ignored his unethical order & this year in a trial, Anthony’s murderers were convicted of murder & the special circumstance was found true. If it was up to Gascón, Anthony’s killers would have been eligible for parole at some point. That would have been an injustice. But bc Anthony was not famous or rich, Gascón didn’t really care. Why do I point this out? Gascón has denied equal justice for so many families. His blanket policies weren’t a reform. They were an injustice. Just because your case is in the media, or because the victim or defendant is famous or wealthy, that should NEVER be the reason to file charges, allegations & special circumstances. It should always be based on evidence & the law. All of us deserve EQUAL justice under the law. ALL of us. Gascón must go.

Judge Cannon should order, from the bench, that all records related to Bratt's meetings and discussions at the White House be preserved and provided to the court; and, she should ask the DC judge who has been dragging his feet in his secret review of the allegation against Bratt by Woodward transfer that matter and all the information related to it to her as it clearly bears on the document case that is now before her and in her jurisdiction.
