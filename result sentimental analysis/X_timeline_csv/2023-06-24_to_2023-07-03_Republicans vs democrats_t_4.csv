In addition, it is categorically false to claim that ""all vaccine trials"" included an ""immunologically inert"" control. This is because most childhood vaccine trials used other vaccines as a control, which, by definition, are immunologically active. The use of vaccines as controls is highly concerning because the control vaccines were virtually never licensed based on a placebo-controlled trial ‚Äì meaning ""inert"" per CDC/FDA. This is true even for trials of the first vaccine for a target disease. Hence, the safety of the subject or control vaccine was virtually never properly assessed in any clinical trial. For example, Prevnar-13 was licensed based on a trial comparing it to Prevnar-7, and Prevnar-7 was licensed based on a trial comparing it to another experimental vaccine. ""Serious adverse events reported following vaccination in infants and toddlers occurred in 8.2% among Prevnar 13 recipients and 7.2% among Prevnar 7 recipients."" Meaning, equally safe by FDA standards. But equally unsafe by any other standard. As another example, in Gardasil‚Äôs trial, 2.3% of the Gardasil group and 2.3% of the control group (which received an injection of a proprietary adjuvant which can cause autoimmune issues) had a suspected autoimmune disorder. Again, meaning equally safe by FDA standards. But equally unsafe by any other standard. I trust you agree that the safety of products injected repeatedly into babies is very important. Without an inert comparator, harm can be obfuscated. While you label it ""absurd"" to define a placebo as having ""no effect on living beings,"" that is, verbatim, the CDC‚Äôs definition of ""placebo"" in its Vaccine Glossary. What is ""absurd"" is to define a ""placebo"" as a vaccine or an adjuvant. As this is a critically important issue, I gladly welcome a respectful in-person discussion where we each present our evidence regarding clinical trials for childhood vaccines to best understand each other‚Äôs position for the common goal of protecting children.

In addition, it is categorically false to claim that ""all vaccine trials"" included an ""immunologically inert"" control. This is because most childhood vaccine trials used other vaccines as a control, which, by definition, are immunologically active. The use of vaccines as controls is highly concerning because the control vaccines were virtually never licensed based on a placebo-controlled trial ‚Äì meaning ""inert"" per CDC/FDA. This is true even for trials of the first vaccine for a target disease. Hence, the safety of the subject or control vaccine was virtually never properly assessed in any clinical trial. For example, Prevnar-13 was licensed based on a trial comparing it to Prevnar-7, and Prevnar-7 was licensed based on a trial comparing it to another experimental vaccine. ""Serious adverse events reported following vaccination in infants and toddlers occurred in 8.2% among Prevnar 13 recipients and 7.2% among Prevnar 7 recipients."" Meaning, equally safe by FDA standards. But equally unsafe by any other standard. As another example, in Gardasil‚Äôs trial, 2.3% of the Gardasil group and 2.3% of the control group (which received an injection of a proprietary adjuvant which can cause autoimmune issues) had a suspected autoimmune disorder. Again, meaning equally safe by FDA standards. But equally unsafe by any other standard. I trust you agree that the safety of products injected repeatedly into babies is very important. Without an inert comparator, harm can be obfuscated. While you label it ""absurd"" to define a placebo as having ""no effect on living beings,"" that is, verbatim, the CDC‚Äôs definition of ""placebo"" in its Vaccine Glossary. What is ""absurd"" is to define a ""placebo"" as a vaccine or an adjuvant. As this is a critically important issue, I gladly welcome a respectful in-person discussion where we each present our evidence regarding clinical trials for childhood vaccines to best understand each other‚Äôs position for the common goal of protecting children.

Dame himself says that's a concern of his, which I noted in my recent @ringer article: But the Nets with Dame aren't quite on the level of some other teams either. So I think you have to factor in sleeper teams‚Äîmost notably the Spurs, as @ramonashelburne acknowledged below‚Äîwho have a ton of future picks: As @wojespn chimed in, Dame doesn't have a no-trade clause. The Blazers can actually trade him wherever they want to, which is especially noteworthy since Miami's best offer isn't all that great. The Spurs still have $28M in cap space they could use to sign free agents (Brook Lopez?) and then they have tradable contracts with a large number of future picks to outbid any other team for Dame.
