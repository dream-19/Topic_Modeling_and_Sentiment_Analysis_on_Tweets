It spends around 8 percent of its GDP on defense. And it has fought bravely for 75 years in numerous wars and battles. Your statement is absurd. Nonetheless, it’s a tiny country with few people. It’s enemies not only receive billions in weapons from our enemies, but in the case of Iran billions from our country via Biden’s policies. However, you miss the point entirely. Israel is an ally in a very dangerous part of the world. We need Israel as a counterweight to Iran, Syria, terrorist organizations, etc. You seem oblivious to America’s need to have strong and reliable allies throughout the world to help our own security needs. Foreign policy should be based on prudence not flip ideological comments. You’re not ensuring our security you’re ensuring we will need a much larger military, many more service personnel, bigger intelligence operations, more ships and aircraft, etc., if we do as you suggest. Our allies benefit from our support, but we benefit from them being our first line of defense in certain parts of the world. Your position is not well considered. Happy to discuss further with you on my radio show after next week’s debate, although it’s always tough to get you on. Moreover, you can’t just say you’re going to create more Abraham Accords and then walk away. First, nobody will enter into a new accord if we take your position. Why would they? You just going to sweet talk them into it? Our role there is what created the accords, as President Trump understood. Second, the Abraham Accords actually expand our role in the Middle East. China, Russia and Iran would salivate if we did as you say. Yet, you say you support them. You’ve essentially said the same about Taiwan. Somehow Taiwan will help us build a computer chip industry then we abandon them. That’s nonsensical. Nor is it in our best interests. From Goldwater to Trump, no serious Republican or conservative has believed as you do. I fear your foreign policy is more in line with Bernie Sanders or the late George McGovern. Maybe even the Squad I also believe it’s much more likely to cause a world war as China and others see appeasement and weakness and great opportunities. I’m all for outsiders. But, respectfully, you need to bone up a bit on this subject. It’s not about forever wars, which have nothing to do with this, or new thinking. It’s old and failed and provocative thinking. Nothing novel or smart about it. IMHO.
