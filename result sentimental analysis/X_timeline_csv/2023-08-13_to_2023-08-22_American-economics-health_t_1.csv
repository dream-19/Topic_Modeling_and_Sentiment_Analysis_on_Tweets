Biden proclaimed Bidenomics “is working,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen insisted “Americans feel good,” and Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer boasted of an economy “doing so well.” Americans aren’t seeing it that way; “Bidenomics” has become a major drag on families across the country. Here are the cold, hard facts on the Biden economy: • Prices are up by 16.9% since Biden took office. • Real wages are down by about three percent since Biden took office. • The nationwide average for regular gas is up $1.48/gallon since Biden took office. • Americans have paid over $2,250 more in increased energy costs since Biden took office. • Americans’ savings, real incomes, and economic confidence are all down. • Households are spending $709 more than they did two years ago for the same goods and services. • Credit card debt is at an all-time high as credit card delinquencies have surpassed pre-pandemic levels. • Americans are being punished by the highest interest rates in 22 years. • Nearly 20 million American households are behind on their utility bills. • 60 percent of workers report living paycheck-to-paycheck — including 73 percent of millennials. • Nearly three-fourths of Americans say their financial situation is not improving, while almost half say it’s actively “getting worse.” • Most Americans think the country is on the wrong track. All told, Americans have lost an average of $10,000 paying the increased costs of living under Biden.
