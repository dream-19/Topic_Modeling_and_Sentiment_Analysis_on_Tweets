A sham from the very beginning. One of Willis' main claims was that electors for Trump engaged in an 'unlawful conspiracy' to overturn the election. According to bombshell transcripts, Willis' allegations appear to be false. The @FDRLST has uncovered a transcript of a meeting on December 14th, 2020, showing the intent of the electors was *NOT* to impersonate public officials like Willis claimed. Willis claimed that Georgia Republican elector David Shafer took part in this 'conspiracy' however transcripts appear to prove that this is false. “[Trump] has filed a contest to the certified returns. That contest — is pending [and has] not been decided or even heard by any judge with the authority to hear it. And so in order to preserve his rights, it’s important that the Republican nominees for Presidential Elector meet here today and cast their votes,"" Shafer said at the meeting. Shafer and then-President Trump had filed a lawsuit in early December claiming thousands of illegal votes had been casted. Their lawsuit was still pending when the meeting took place. Shafer, who alongside other Georgia Republican electors casted their electoral votes for Trump, made it clear that he was filing alternate electors so the judge would ""consider the merits of our complaint."" “And so the only way for us to have any judge consider the merits of our complaint, the thousands of people we allege voted unlawfully, is for us to have this meeting and permit the contest to continue?” Shafer asked Trump's attorney at the time. “That’s correct,” the attorney replied.

Adding insult to injury for Trump, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson tells ABC News that “she and other secretaries of state from Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada, New Hampshire and Maine started having conversations over a year ago about preparing for the legal challenges to Trump's candidacy.” This news comes as legal scholars across America — from both sides of the political aisle — are calling for Trump to be banned due to Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment, which states that an elected official is not eligible to assume public office if that person ""engaged in insurrection or rebellion against.” That description fits Trump and his actions like a glove.

All the pointless talk is intended to obscure a concerted effort to undermine China’s economy because we cannot compete with it in various strategic sectors, while—part two—buying time to move maximum U.S. military hardware as close to the mainland as possible under the program the Defense Department named a few years ago the Pacific Defense Initiative, the PDI. [...] What the Biden administration is doing comes down to securitizing the economic relationship. If you have ever doubted that the United States is a failing imperium unwilling to accept 21st century realities, I offer this as proof of the proposition. The Chinese know this and have said so many times. I no longer think Blinken, Yellen, et al. have any thought of persuading them otherwise on these journeys. That only looks like their intent. Their true purpose is in the way of theatrical, and Americans are their true audience: They must make sure we do not understand Gina Raimondo’s efforts to punch the Chinese well below their belts for what they are: an uncompetitive nation’s attempts to hold back a rising economic power. I found that speech Sullivan delivered last spring interesting for what he left out as much as for what was in it. There was not a single mention of the U.S. military buildup at the western end of the Pacific. Talk about elephants in the living room. The Pentagon is developing the Australian–British–U.S. alliance known as AUKUS, there is the Quad group, comprising the U.S., Australia, India, and Japan, there are these recently and assiduously fortified alliances with Seoul, Tokyo, Manila, and Canberra, and none of this, we hear again and again, has anything to do with surrounding China or providing for the movement of U.S. military capabilities westward toward the mainland. This is only “seemingly” the case, as The Times would put it. It is the same as with Raimondo’s projects on the technology side: Neither the Chinese nor anyone else in Asia believes these silly explanations, and no one expects them to do so. Beijing knows very well there is a point to all these apparently pointless visits U.S. officials insist on making. The Biden regime is buying time as it remilitarizes the western end of the Pacific. The only people who are supposed to understand otherwise are Americans. We are not supposed to watch as Washington provokes and prosecutes Cold War II before our eyes. We are supposed to watch as American officials—reasonable, constructive, well-intended—make all efforts to talk to the Chinese in the face of their stubborn reluctance to cooperate. This is my revised take on the Blinken–Yellen–Kerry–Raimondo cavalcade across the Pacific. These people are not clods. They are purposefully malicious and, it should go without saying, are making the world even more dangerous than it already is."" https://t.co/b9hcPcMBT1",read patrick lawrence foreign affair columnist

Trump lacks certain qualities which the British traditionally esteem. For instance, he has no class, no charm, no coolness, no credibility, no compassion, no wit, no warmth, no wisdom, no subtlety, no sensitivity, no self-awareness, no humility, no honour and no grace – all qualities, funnily enough, with which his predecessor Mr. Obama was generously blessed. So for us, the stark contrast does rather throw Trump’s limitations into embarrassingly sharp relief. Plus, we like a laugh. And while Trump may be laughable, he has never once said anything wry, witty or even faintly amusing – not once, ever. I don’t say that rhetorically, I mean it quite literally: not once, not ever. And that fact is particularly disturbing to the British sensibility – for us, to lack humour is almost inhuman. But with Trump, it’s a fact. He doesn’t even seem to understand what a joke is – his idea of a joke is a crass comment, an illiterate insult, a casual act of cruelty. Trump is a troll. And like all trolls, he is never funny and he never laughs; he only crows or jeers. And scarily, he doesn’t just talk in crude, witless insults – he actually thinks in them. His mind is a simple bot-like algorithm of petty prejudices and knee-jerk nastiness. There is never any under-layer of irony, complexity, nuance or depth. It’s all surface. Some Americans might see this as refreshingly upfront. Well, we don’t. We see it as having no inner world, no soul. And in Britain we traditionally side with David, not Goliath. All our heroes are plucky underdogs: Robin Hood, Dick Whittington, Oliver Twist. Trump is neither plucky, nor an underdog. He is the exact opposite of that. He’s not even a spoiled rich-boy, or a greedy fat-cat. He’s more a fat white slug. A Jabba the Hutt of privilege. And worse, he is that most unforgivable of all things to the British: a bully. That is, except when he is among bullies; then he suddenly transforms into a snivelling sidekick instead. There are unspoken rules to this stuff – the Queensberry rules of basic decency – and he breaks them all. He punches downwards – which a gentleman should, would, could never do – and every blow he aims is below the belt. He particularly likes to kick the vulnerable or voiceless – and he kicks them when they are down. So the fact that a significant minority – perhaps a third – of Americans look at what he does, listen to what he says, and then think ‘Yeah, he seems like my kind of guy’ is a matter of some confusion and no little distress to British people, given that: • Americans are supposed to be nicer than us, and mostly are. • You don’t need a particularly keen eye for detail to spot a few flaws in the man. This last point is what especially confuses and dismays British people, and many other people too; his faults seem pretty bloody hard to miss. After all, it’s impossible to read a single tweet, or hear him speak a sentence or two, without staring deep into the abyss. He turns being artless into an art form; he is a Picasso of pettiness; a Shakespeare of shit. His faults are fractal: even his flaws have flaws, and so on ad infinitum. God knows there have always been stupid people in the world, and plenty of nasty people too. But rarely has stupidity been so nasty, or nastiness so stupid. He makes Nixon look trustworthy and George W look smart. In fact, if Frankenstein decided to make a monster assembled entirely from human flaws – he would make a Trump. And a remorseful Doctor Frankenstein would clutch out big clumpfuls of hair and scream in anguish: ‘My God… what… have… I… created?' If being a twat was a TV show, Trump would be the boxed set.” -Nate White",british writer penned best description donald trump read british people like donald trump thing spring mind trump lack

Stephen Douglas to seven 3-hour debates in congressional districts throughout Illinois. Lincoln was the Republican nominee, Douglas the Democrat nominee for senator. Even though the state legislature selected the senator, the two candidates agreed it was very important that both present their views, especially about slavery, to the citizens of the state. Plus, it could have an impact on how the legislature would eventually vote. The role of the press back then was basically to transcribe what the two men said at each debate and make it available to the general public; they were not moderators of any of the debates. The debates were public events. People from all walks of life would attend. Douglas would win re-election on the vote of the legislature, but it was fairly close. In 1860, the transcribed debates were published in a book, which Lincoln used, in part, to run for president in 1860. Lincoln would win barely 40% of the popular vote but won the presidency via the Electoral College. So much for eliminating the Electoral College. If Lincoln had not won, it's very like the United States would have dissolved. If debates were conducted this way in America today, where serious candidates with some level of support beyond 5% debate each other for a period of several hours, without interruption by press-directed questions but instead debate rules negotiated and agreed to in advance by the two major parties or even the two or three major/leading candidates, I believe the nation would benefit enormously. The 1860 election was among the most important, if not the most important, in American history. The next such election will be 2024. The issues of secession, slavery, and nullification were all on the table. Dred Scott had been decided (wrongly) by the Supreme Court just a few years earlier. Today, the issue of the Constitution and the Republic are also on the table, as the same Democrat Party seeks to replace them with its own ideology and the relentless use of governmental power in ways once thought unimaginable. From CRT and the war on the nuclear family, to indicting and seeking the imprisonment of the leading Republican running for President as well as others opposed the Democrat Party policies, from protecting the current Democrat President from investigation for widespread criminality, to the Democrat Party regime seeking to destroy the independence of the Supreme Court and alter the voting system to empower itself and disenfranchise tens of millions of voters (mostly Republicans), from eviscerating the Bill of Rights and the nation's sovereign borders, and so much more -- with a Democrat Party press cheering all the way -- the 2024 election will likely determine if we are nation of liberty or tyranny. Incredibly, there will never be a series of long form debates between the Republican and Democrat nominees for president in 2024 because the eventual Democrat Party nominee is mentally incapable of speaking beyond a few soundbites. That would've been absolutely unacceptable in 1858. Back then, the press would've mocked and humiliated Joe Biden, not serve as his stenographers and chief defenders. But today, we do not have a free press. We have a press that is free to undermine our country.",abraham lincoln challenged sen stephen douglas seven hour debate congressional district illinois lincoln republican nominee douglas democrat

As someone who is now polling in second or third place in most major national polls, I would be able to more easily win this GOP primary if Trump were eliminated from competition, but that’s not how I want to succeed. I stand on principle over politics, which is why I am sharing the following viewpoint despite the fact that Trump is one of my opponents in this primary: Section 3 of the 14th Amendment states that any person who has “previously taken an oath ... as an officer of the United States ... to support the Constitution” is disqualified from holding public office if that person engaged “in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.” Politicized groups are attempting to make Trump ineligible to run for president, arguing he fomented and in fact engaged in insurrection on January 6. This is a perversion of the 14th Amendment. The 14th Amendment was part of the “Reconstruction Amendments” that were ratified following the Civil War. It was passed to prohibit former Confederate military and political leaders from holding high federal or state office. These men had clearly taken part in a rebellion against the United States: the Civil War. Participants in the events of January 6 did not. And Trump, of course, was not even among them. That makes it all the more absurd that a left-wing group in Colorado is asking a federal court to disqualify the former president on the same grounds, arguing that his stump speeches on and before January 6 equate to rebellion against the United States. And there’s another legal problem: Trump is not a former “officer of the United States,” as that term is used in the Constitution, meaning Section 3 does not apply. As the Supreme Court explained in Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (2010), an “officer of the United States” is someone appointed by the president to aid him in his duties under Article II, Section 2. The term does not apply to elected officials, and certainly not to the president himself. The Framers of the 14th Amendment would be shocked and appalled to see their narrow provision—intended to bar former U.S officials who switched to the Confederacy from seeking public office—being weaponized by a sitting president and his political allies to prevent a former president from seeking reelection. I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: President Biden and his allies are engaging in election interference of the highest order. Yesterday’s filing is just the latest in a string of baseless lawsuits designed to silence political opponents and swing the election for Joe Biden, this time by depriving Americans of the right to vote for their candidate of choice. The judge assigned to this case should immediately toss it out. Our country is becoming unrecognizable to anyone who understands our Constitution, and we don’t have long to fix it.",having tried trick book eliminate president trump running election left deploying

But back in march I tweeted this. Many in the alternative press and military analysts on X knew it too. The failed Ukrainian counter offensive has not just been a disaster for Ukraine. It has been a monumental failure of NATO intelligence and has laid bare the intellectual ineptitude of the Western mainstream press. How could this have happened? I did expect Ukraine to have more success than they did. And many Russians did too. When I drove through Zaphorozhie region recently I saw newly dug defensive lines as far south as the Black Sea. They were prepared. I’ve spent must of the last year in Donbass. It’s tough on the frontlines. Much tougher than Russia would like to admit. War is hell. But the reality is that insufficient air or artillery superiority, Ukrainian generals warning they weren’t ready. A year long self deluding media campaign about the incompetency of the Russian army. It was clear to those in the know it would be a disaster. If ukriane did have success, Russia has such great reserves they would have reversed it. Absurd, deluded articles about Russian conscripts who would apparently flee British Challenger 2’s. Think tanks obsessed with the propaganda war while Russia lays millions of mines. Anyone who even suggests peace is labeled a Kremlin asset. Meaning anyone in politics, journalism or civil society who questions the inept and self destructive policies risks losing their job and their ability to support their families. This isn’t freedom. It’s a fear culture. A form of intellectual lobotomy that is destroying Britains ability to form prosperous policy. The shocking standard of British reporting is damaging British interests by being so inept in their judgements. By attempting to fool the public they are also fooling themselves and members of parliament. Most of whom know little of international affairs bar what they read in these same papers. As a reporter in Donbass I was often asked to comment on events elsewhere in Ukraine. I would look at the mainstream press to do so as they have many reporters in Ukraine. Over the course of the war I have simply found them too unreliable to treat as credible sources. When a Ukrainian missile hit an apartment block around the corner from me in Donetsk. And a certain outlet casually blamed it on Russia it was the last straw. There are some outstanding mainstream journalists and many super nice people but the editorial standards are ruining their institutions reputations. Which is why people are flocking elsewhere for their news. Instead of rectifying this by reporting more honestly, they try to discredit the outlets people go to instead. It’s a self defeating and ultimately doomed strategy. More so, if the British MOD really thought they could succeed then it has been an intelligence failure on a monumental scale. We now see reports coming out about why it has failed. It was clear to the rest of us before it started. Europe is suffering a crisis of leadership. Corporations and big money have become too powerful. And we have shipped out our foreign policy to the US. Naively believing their interests are the same as ours. They are not. There are few real European patriots left in positions of power or in the media. And even fewer with the courage and intellectual ability to read the changing tides of history and of the new path that Europe must inevitably plough.",prediction tend fool march tweeted alternative

On the day of the attack when the first plane hit, Rescorla ordered everyone out of the building, ignoring the Port Authority order to stay put. “I said, ‘Piss off, you son of a b***h,’” Rescorla recounted to a friend that morning. “Everything above where that plane hit is going to collapse, and it’s going to take the whole building with it. I’m getting my people the f**k out of here.” The last time Rescorla was ever seen was on the 10th floor of the South Tower going up to save more people. He saved 2700 people that day.
