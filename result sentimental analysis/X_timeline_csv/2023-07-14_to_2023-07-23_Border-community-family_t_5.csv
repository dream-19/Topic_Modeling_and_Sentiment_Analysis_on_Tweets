Meek is expected to face much less than the maximum 20 years in prison after entering a plea agreement. Investigators found disturbing messages on Meek’s phone where he bragged about raping a toddler. “Have you ever raped a toddler girl? It’s amazing,” Meek said in one message. Another detailed his fantasy of, “abducting, drugging, and raping” a 12 year old girl.
