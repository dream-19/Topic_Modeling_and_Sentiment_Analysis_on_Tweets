They insisted this was a necessary and righteous price to pay for the country. But if the federal government takes a long holiday, as if it’s Christmas time, we’re told the sky is falling. We live in a government-centric time, where the ruling class and its media care only about protecting their own interests and power. It’s also why you hear nothing about the Democrat Party’s scurrilous budget tactics, supported by the McConnell Senate RINOs, which include blowing through the spending caps agreed to in May and doing nothing about the open borders. They get a complete pass. No media discussion about the unsustainable spending and borrowing that the GAO, CBO and OMB have all warned about in no uncertain terms, as fiscal and national security disasters. That said, the 5 Republicans who refused to support a proposal negotiated by Byron Donalds, including an 8 percent cut in domestic spending (excluding Defense and veterans benefits), and significant border security measures, have done more harm than good. Given what we know about the Democrat Party media, the GOP will be attacked, which is par for the course, but for what? It’s one thing to take a principled stand with a strategy and endgame. It’s another to have a temper tantrum and nothing more. I remember that every time the government was shut down under Reagan, 6 times, it was over a specific policy or program that he wanted funded or defunded, as well as cutting overall spending. There was no confusion about his demands. The 5 are not only all over the map, they cannot accomplish anything. That’s Pickett’s charge.",union station  waiting train forced watch cnn government shutdown looming actually mean vast majority government remains open medium drumbeat end time sickening governor

In his statement he blasts failed Democrat policies destroying US cities. “I have been mayor of Dallas for more than four years. During that time, my priority has been to make the city safer, stronger and more vibrant. That meant saying no to those who wanted to defund the police. It meant fighting for lower taxes and a friendlier business climate. And it meant investing in family friendly infrastructure such as better parks and trails. That approach is working. Alone among America’s 10 most populous cities, Dallas has brought violent crime down in every major category, including murder, year-over-year for the past two years. In a recent Gallup poll asking Americans to rate the safety of major cities, Dallas came out on top. We have also reduced our property tax rate every year since I took office, signaling to investors that Dallas intends to remain the nation’s most pro-business city… After these wins for the people of Dallas — and after securing 98.7% of the vote in my re-election campaign this year — I have no intention of changing my approach to my job. But today I am changing my party affiliation. Next spring, I will be voting in the Republican primary. When my career in elected office ends in 2027 on the inauguration of my successor as mayor, I will leave office as a Republican… I realize this will come as a surprise to many. During the decade I spent serving my hometown in the Texas House of Representatives, I was a Democrat in a Republican-controlled Legislature. I prided myself on finding common-sense solutions and worked closely with my conservative colleagues to improve policing, public education and water infrastructure. I was never a favorite of the Democratic caucus, and the feeling was mutual... The future of America’s great urban centers depends on the willingness of the nation’s mayors to champion law and order and practice fiscal conservatism. Our cities desperately need the genuine commitment to these principles (as opposed to the inconsistent, poll-driven commitment of many Democrats) that has long been a defining characteristic of the GOP. In other words, American cities need Republicans—and Republicans need American cities. When my political hero Theodore Roosevelt was born, only 20% of Americans lived in urban areas… Today, it stands at 80%. As America’s cities go, so goes America. Unfortunately, many of our cities are in disarray. Mayors and other local elected officials have failed to make public safety a priority or to exercise fiscal restraint. Most of these local leaders are proud Democrats who view cities as laboratories for liberalism rather than as havens for opportunity and free enterprise. Too often, local tax dollars are spent on policies that exacerbate homelessness, coddle criminals and make it harder for ordinary people to make a living. And too many local Democrats insist on virtue signaling—proposing half-baked government programs that aim to solve every single societal ill—and on finding new ways to thumb their noses at Republicans at the state or federal level. Enough. This makes for good headlines, but not for safer, stronger, more vibrant cities. With my change in party affiliation, I recognize that the number of Republican mayors leading the nation’s 10 largest cities has increased from zero to one. This is hardly a red wave. But it is clear that the nation and its cities have reached a time for choosing. And the overwhelming majority of Americans who call our cities home deserve to have real choices—not “progressive” echo chambers—at city hall.” Texas GOP Chairman @MattRinaldiTX has welcomed Johnson to the party. “I served with @Johnson4Dallas in the Texas House and found him to be an intelligent and pragmatic Democrat who would be more at home among Republicans. I’m glad he came to that same conclusion and welcome him to our party.”",dallas mayor eric johnson served  legislature democrat announced  switching party statement blast failed democrat policy

ANSWER: 1. #TrickleDownIdentity - the good of the rich is my good. And we Democrats don't confront this. We are no longer the party of FDR. 2. We delight in the ALIENATION of the middle class. Let's #BlueWave2024 with slogans - ""We need a #WhitePrivilegeTax""! and "" Real Immigrants that built America WADED THE RIVER and JUMPED the FENCE only a Fascist bigot would believe otherwise!""🤔 Oh sure we will win big time with that philosophy. 3.

ANSWER: I did not do it and my white skin doesn't make me any more guilty than the ole Religion of Adam 🍎 and Eve. We DO need to teach ALL of the HORROR of slavery. But not ALIENATE today Whites as being personally guilty.....No you say? 👉Ok let's #BlueWave with slogans of a WHITE PRIVILEGE TAX 🥳🎉🎉.

Roosevelt proposed a second Bill of Rights to secure economic rights for the American People. In his view, hunger and unemployment were “the stuff of which dictatorships are made.” Roosevelt: “This Republic had its beginning, and grew to its present strength, under the protection of certain inalienable political rights. As our nation has grown in size and stature, however, these political rights proved inadequate to assure us equality in the pursuit of happiness. We have accepted, so to speak, a second Bill of Rights under which a new basis of security and prosperity can be established for all, regardless of station, race, or creed. Among these are: 1) The right to a useful and remunerative job, 2) The right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation, 3) The right of every farmer to raise and sell his products at a return which will give him and his family a decent living, 4) The right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopolies at home or abroad, 5) The right of every family to a decent home, 6) The right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health, 7) The right to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment, 8) The right to a good education. All of these rights spell security. And after this war is won, we must be prepared to move forward in the implementation of these rights to new goals of human happiness and well-being. For unless there is security here at home, there cannot be lasting peace in the world.”",january president franklin  roosevelt proposed second bill right secure economic right american people view

The historic ""School Lunch Debt Cancellation Act"" is already getting vitriolic pushback from MAGA Republicans who apparently will defend any means of turning profit, even if it hurts children. The idea of ""school lunch debt"" would sound insane anywhere else in the world, but in America hungry students are often given food at school but then forced to pay for it later — which the poor often cannot afford to do. As a result, they accumulate crippling debt. Astonishingly, there are 30 million children in the United States — the wealthiest nation in the history of the world — who cannot afford their school meals. They carry an accumulated total of $262 million in school meal debt annually. ""‘School lunch debt’ is a term so absurd that it shouldn’t even exist,"" said Fetterman in a press release. ""That’s why I’m proud to introduce this bill to cancel the nation’s student meal debt and stop humiliating kids and penalizing hunger."" “It’s time to come together and stop playing political games with Americans' access to food,"" he went on. ""September is Hunger Action Month and I’m proud to be introducing this bill to help working families now, while we work to move our other priorities to combat food insecurity in our nation."" If passed, the bill would direct the United States Department of Agriculture to pay for all debts owed to school for lunch or breakfast programs.

Long-term Vision: - Trump (The Statesman): Pledges a future where the automobile industry thrives on American resources and labor: “My pledge to everyone is that a vote for President Trump means the future of the automobile will be made in America.” - Biden (The Politician): Focuses on global competition without addressing immediate concerns: ""China has been leading in this race, but that’s about to change,” regarding infrastructure spending. 2. Reality Check: - Trump: Provides a realistic outlook on the implications of policy decisions: “You’re all on the picket lines and everything, but it doesn’t make a damn bit of difference what you get, because in two years you’re all going to be out of business.” - Biden: No additional quote. (It’s hard enough to listen to him talk, but to read his words...) 3. Engagement with the Present: - Trump: Directly addresses the concerns of the workers and the impact of political decisions: “He’s selling you out to China, he’s selling you out to the environmental extremists and the radical left.” - Biden: Offers praise to union leaders without addressing the current strike issues: ""No one does more to look out for American autoworkers than Ray Curry."" 4. Addressing Challenges: - Trump: Openly discusses the challenges and urges for a change in approach: “He only came after I announced that I would be here.” - Biden: No additional quote. (Y'all, it hurts my eyes to look at his drivel.) 5. Guidance: - Trump: Provides clear guidance urging union leadership to align with his vision for preserving jobs: “Your leadership should endorse and I won’t say a bad thing about them again,” Trump said. “They have to endorse Trump or else they’re committing suicide … committing suicide on the backs of your jobs."" - Biden: Advocates for fair share from corporate America without providing a clear pathway to address current challenges: ""Look, I’m a capitalist... but pay a little. Pay a little.” Compare the contrasting approaches of Trump and Biden, with Trump exhibiting characteristics of a statesman through his long-term vision, realistic assessments, direct engagement with current challenges, and clear guidance, while Biden's approach aligns more with traditional political rhetoric and less engagement with the immediate concerns of the auto workers.
