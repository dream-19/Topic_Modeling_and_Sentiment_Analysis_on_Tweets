Vladimir Putin has acted in a craven manner, but that shouldn‚Äôt trick the U.S. establishment into adopting the false narrative that Zelensky is a paragon of democratic leadership. He is not. In a span of just two years, Zelensky has made moves that bear a striking resemblance to the tactics employed by Vladimir Putin: Zelensky‚Äôs actions include the banning of 11 opposition parties and the consolidation of all state media into a single entity. These actions not only mirror Putin‚Äôs refusal to register opposition parties but also extensive government control over the media landscape.

We will be Uncle Sucker no more. With over $135 billion in funding already provided, Ukraine should easily be able to allocate 0.1 percent of that to pay for their election. Of course, the mainstream media and the establishment will say that any money the U.S. sends to support Ukraine is strictly ‚Äúitemized and audited‚Äù so that it can‚Äôt be used that way.
