Evidence is clearly otherwise. The 2017 tax cut - where 83 cents of every dollar went into the hands of the wealthiest Individuals and corporations - will never pay for itself. Giving tax cuts to companies already making billions in profit did not make them invest; the money mainly went to stock buybacks etc. When corporatists talk about reducing the deficit, they are only willing to do so on the backs of the middle class and poor. They are never willing to spend money on catching wealthy tax cheats, repealing unfair tax cuts to the very wealthy, or increasing investment in things that actually support the average person in creating more wealth.
