Here’s a day in the life of “Bidenomics” for millions of Americans: • You wake up and have your cup of coffee, which is 30% more expensive than when Biden took office. • You head to work, but filling up your car costs over a $1.40 more per gallon then when Biden took office, and has been above $3 a gallon for over 800 days. • You’re expecting a paycheck today, but it’s roughly 3% lower in real terms than when Biden took office. • You get home and see a stack of bills, cringing because your rent is up 15.9% and your electric bill is 24.6% more expensive under Biden. • It would be nice to go out to eat, but unfortunately, the cost of going out to eat under Biden has skyrocketed 19.3%. • When you head to the grocery store, you don’t get much relief. Under Biden, grocery prices are up 19.3%. • Time and time again, you need to rely on your credit card and “buy now, pay later” apps to make it to the end of the month. Now, your credit card debt is at an all-time high. • You’re forced to take a hardship withdrawal from your 401(k) to make ends meet. • You toss and turn falling asleep, struggling to forget that the interest rate on your credit card debt is surging. This is the “Bidenomics” snake oil Biden is selling. Americans’ opinions of it are clear. Only two percent say the economy is “excellent” while 78% rate the economy negatively. Only 36% approve of Biden on the economy. Here’s the point: Biden’s absurd spin can’t change the reality of “Bidenomics” for Americans living it.
