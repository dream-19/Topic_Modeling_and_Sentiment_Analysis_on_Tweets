Almost all of them were diagnosed with depression, GAD, bipolar, or BPD. Most were highly medicated— some to a point that still sticks with me years later. As I got to know their background and lives 3 things were very clear: 1. A vast majority had been emotionally neglected, emotionally abused, or physically abused as children. 2. A vast majority had experienced domestic violence or were currently living in it. 3. Basic needs were never met. Life was an hour by hour struggle. Treatment was an attempt to allow them to get to work in most cases. To just continue to surviving. It was the start of me questioning the field I had been trained in. One that diagnoses people with disorders without taking a look at the whole picture. It began my path of holistic understanding. A person cannot be well when one unexpected bill will have them fall behind on rent. When they lay their head on a pillow and all they can think about is expenses piling up. When a bill at the grocery store is almost double what they paid last year when their income has stayed the same. An entire family unit deeply struggles within survival mode. When a job is lost. When daycare needs to be paid, but so does the light bill— what do you choose? When parents can’t even think about the emotional needs of their children because they have to figure out where their next meal is going to come from. In 1942, 10 years before the diagnostic manual of mental illness was released Maslow knew what was once just common sense: we have a hierarchy of needs. At the bottom are basic needs food and shelter. Then safety (resources, security). Then belonging (connection, friendship, intimacy.) Without three things we *will* be sick, period. I get pushback for questioning the status quo. And I’ll continue to do it. The status quo is keeping people sick. It denies their experience. And it says we should bandage people’s symptoms so they can return to the environment that made them sick. May we wake up, heal ourselves, and build conscious communities to help each other.

Let's do the math on a per child basis. There are about 75m kids 17 and under, and 25m 0 - 5 yrs old. Do the parents of those kids under 5 get anything ? I'll presume not So your 80b is allocated across 50m kids. That's 1600 per kid right? Per Year. Right $800 per semester ? How do you think that $1600 gets spent? But wait there's more. Let's say parents are efficient buyers and schools go along with letting any child in. Do you think the best public schools will accept any child for $1600 ? Possibly over-flowing their schools? Requiring more local and state tax money to expand ? And,I'm guessing your biggest donors will have something to say about who goes to their kid's school. My NIMBY-dar is strong on this one. So let's pretend that parents and schools figure out some equilibrium and there are schools that will add the children for 1600. Who is going to pay for make those schools bigger ? Do you think $1600 per additional child will cover the capital and ongoing expenses bill ? How happy do you think taxpayers w no kids will be about that ? But wait there is more... at first glance giving $1600 to parents may sound great, but the reality is not every parent can take their kids to school across town. So now you have kids who can only go to the closest school with only 1600 per yr to contribute. But those same schools may have really needed the funds that the DOE offered them . That money is gone. And they are now getting just $1600 per student. Think that covers what they lost ? If not, what happens to the kids that go to those schools ? Do your economics advisors believe that the long term cost to American taxpayers for kids that go to underperforming schools increase or decrease state and federal deficits ? Just for clarification. I think there is unlimited room for improvement in how we handle education in this country. I just think your approach is really dumb PS.

It’s also responsible for tilting the scales towards 4-year degrees instead of vocational training over the last few decades with disastrous consequences for my generation (millennials). The Department was formed at a time when the federal government allocated money to states but when some states failed to send that money to predominantly black school districts. That era is now long behind us, and today the real problem is that the schools that spend the *most* money per student (often in the inner cities) are the ones delivering the *worst* results on a per-student basis. When a government agency outlives its initial purpose, bureaucrats eventually start finding new things to do that are unnecessary and often harmful: the US Dept of Education is a classic example of that behavior which has become endemic to the federal government. I don’t blame you for having a preconceived notion about me or my policy ideas based on consuming mainstream media, but demand more of yourself. Check out the speech I gave at St. Anselm College a couple months ago or join us in D.C. this Wednesday. Check out one of the many tens of podcasts I’ve done including on this topic. Saving our country is going to require all of us to think independently about the leaders we select, not just passively imbibing the nonsense spewed by the political MSM - which is far worse than any
