For me the jury is out on that. I think leaders use their lived experience to learn what it is to be a leader. Pete Buttigieg is a shining example of how public service helps shape leadership. There’s no better baptism of fire than being a mayor with all the challenges that brings. The first time I heard him speak, I instinctively knew he was the type of politician that rarely graces the political stage. The more I researched the guy, the more impressed I was. He has served his country in uniform as well as in a suit, not something many if any MAGA Republicans can say. His audacious run for President in 2020 was a measure of the man. Above all, it highlighted what an adept communicator he was. Take a listen to the clip below to see just how good he is. His ability to think on his feet and stay ad cool as a still pond regardless of the incoming, is truly impressive. Joe Biden was not slow to notice just what value he could bring to his new government. How right he was. As Secretary of Transport, he has taken on the role intent to stamp his mark. As a skillful advocate for the societal benefits infrastructure, he’s able to articulate the administration’s position, not only on his brief, but on wider political challenges. He’s a polyglot, who learns languages for fun, a musician and now a dad to twins with his husband Chasten. To be a great leader you have to understand the challenges of real American families and while it would be fair to say he didn’t grow up poor, you get the impression that equality and inclusion are both on his bingo card. America you are blessed to have him.

Can we PLEASE stop #Trump and regain #RoeVsWade, end racism, protect #GayMarriage AND Trans from discrimination? STOP THE ALIENATION OF HONEST WHITE VOTERS - LET'S COMBINE. Remember first Earth Day at the TEACH IN where we got our Ph.d in Ecology?🤔 We didn't use the term ""#Woke"" then but I saw a new SECULAR GUILT BASED RELIGION being born. As #LIBERALS we were told nations had to choose: 1. Shrink size of family✅ OR 2. You DIE. We must TRIAGE NATIONS hard as it must be. 😭 Rx Theta Flag Style⤵️ 1. Latin America sorry you DIE! 2. AFRICA goodbye Western Europe and North American Caucasians did obey. Hence DEMOGRAPHICS changed plus due to open borders to those statistical groups not practicing family planning . Open borders added to change in Demographics. Meanwhile....... 👉 ""KAREN"" delayed marriage and having kids🤔 so both her and hubby could crawl out of poverty. QUESTIONS: What would happen if we did NOT shrink our average family size so payck wasn't sliced further? What would happen if 72% of our kids were born out of wedlock? What would happen if even with SMALLER FAMILIES they were single mom (Karen) and BOTH PARENTS were not there to go to work for two paychecks for a smaller family size to slice income up? That is how we CRAWLED out of poverty. This practice latter called #EmotionalIntelligence and the ""DEFERRED GRATIFICATION PATTERN"". Today you call it #WhitePrivilege. Silly me I forgot. The Demographics did NOT change from the DEFERRED GRATIFICATION PATTERN by Whites and open borders. Rather must by LASER DEATH RAYS FROM SPACE. ✅ Someone has to say this #Democrats. STOP THE ALIENATION of honest whites who want to fight residual racism. Most of our ancestors did not own slaves but worked hard. All of us like Blacks as victims of unregulated capitalism. Don't attack them or our kids with Gender Dysphoria Role Modeling. So should we have a WHITE PRIVILEGE TAX? BTW do you REALLY believe we are going to leave this ""STOLEN LAND"" and return to Europe? REALLY? No REALLY? The Lakota STOLE their land from other tribes. The Cherokee even on their ""Trail of tears"" forced migration brought their BLACK SLAVES. When oil was found years later they even tried to disenfranchise the heirs of their Black slaves. Muslims castrated their Black slaves in their Eastern Africa slave trade. But if we Whites do LEAVE PLEASE and return to Europe, do NOT do #CulturalAPPROPRIATION on electricity and railroads, air conditioning or air travel. Just to start. NOT TRYING TO BE NASTY. But my ancestors didn't have a field day in the mines AND I DO RESPECT YOUR ANCESTORS CONTRIBUTIONS. Can we please work together without insulting each other? #LiberalNotWoke #LincolnProject #MorningJoe",psst stop regain end racism protect trans discrimination stop alienation honest white voter let
