I will consummate Abraham Accords 2.0 by the end of 2025, adding Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, and Indonesia to the pact. We will work with Israel to ensure that Iran *never* acquires a nuclear weapon that advances U.S. interests without putting U.S. lives on the line. The U.S. relationship with Israel exemplifies how our international relationships should work. It aligns with my vision to revive realism in our foreign policy: Israel spends a significant percentage of its GDP on defense than any major nation. 75% of the aid we provide to Israel must be spent in the U.S., and by 2028 the mandate is 100%. This is consistent with America-First foreign policy objectives. As U.S. President, I will also learn from our friendship with Israel. I admire Israel’s strong border policies, tough-on-crime laws, strong national identity, and missile defense capabilities – which should motivate us to act similarly here in the U.S. Our aid to Israel will continue until the day when Israel tells the U.S. they’re ready for it to end. We’ll use zero-base budgeting each year in all foreign aid. That’s what true friends do: they speak honestly and openly to one another.
