Within a couple of hours, Israel released irrefutable evidence in video form, intercepted communications of Hamas, and even an Al Jazeera clip from a live broadcast, which showed that it was an Islamic Jihad/Hamas rocket that the terrorists misfired and hit, not the hospital directly but, the parking lot nearby. There is still no confirmation of the number dead and wounded, but the Hamas Caucus did not wait to get credible information before taking the Hamas murderers and rapists of women and children at their word. Nor did Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib pause for a moment to question how it was possible that the ""Gaza Health Ministry,"" i.e., Hamas, could have tallied 500 dead bodies within a few minutes of when the strike was first reported! Worse yet, almost 24 hours later, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, the BBC, and other peddlers of this pernicious blood libel, still haven't removed their erroneous and dangerous tweets! Clearly the Hamas Caucus doesn't give a damn about Palestinian lives because if they did, not only would they immediately retract their statements, but they would reissue them with Hamas and Islamic Jihad as the subject of their scorn rather than Israel. Very clearly, accuracy is not the concern for these fomenters of anti-Jewish violence, but demonizing Israel is. Therefore, we are calling on the House Minority Leader, Hakeem Jeffries, to take action against these dangerous terrorist-lovers by opening an ethics inquiry into their tweets which had, within hours, incited violence against Israeli and American targets around the Middle East and America. Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib and any other member of Congress who promoted this nasty blood libel crossed all lines and exposed their truest intention which is not support for Palestinians but to harm and enfeeble Israel. Hakeem has an opportunity to prove to American Jewry that the Democrats are not the anti-Israel/pro-Hamas party their loudest representatives make them out to be!

I used to say: think, then act. What happened this weekend changed all the rules of play.” The Hamas attack was ghastly, but if the U.S. is going to fund now or backstop this later, then we should openly debate the merits of a ground invasion *now*, instead of regretting it 20 years later as we do now with Iraq & Afghanistan. The left-wing critique of Israel’s pending ground invasion is about “proportionality” or humanitarian concerns in Gaza. Put that to one side, Israel has the right to defend itself. The real question is whether a ground invasion of Gaza with ill-defined objectives can “succeed” at all.

Turning to the Ukraine war, Biden said, “The assault on Israel echoes nearly 20 months of war, tragedy, and brutality inflicted on the people of Ukraine, people who were very badly hurt since Putin launched his all-out invasion.” “Hamas and Putin represent different threats, but they share this in common: They both want to completely annihilate a neighboring democracy,” he stated. “Hamas’ stated purpose for existing is the destruction of the State of Israel and the murder of Jewish people.” “Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people. Hamas uses Palestinian civilians and human shields, and innocent Palestinian civilians are suffering because of that.” ""History has taught us that when terrorists don't pay a price for their terror, when dictators don't pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos and debt and more destruction,"" Biden said. ""They keep going -- and the cost and the threats to America and the world keep rising."" -------- Over the last two decades, America's involvement in wars has yielded staggering consequences, resulting in 37 million people being displaced, 4.5 million lives lost, and an astonishing price tag of $8 trillion.
