The Great Emu War, as it was dubbed, was a military failure and a public embarrassment for the Australian government. The soldiers were armed with machine guns and trucks, but they proved to be ineffective against the fast and agile emus, who scattered and regrouped at will. The emus also seemed to have a remarkable ability to survive bullets, as some of them were reported to have taken up to five shots before falling. The soldiers managed to kill only about 250 emus out of an estimated 20,000. The war ended after six weeks, with the emus declared the victors.",group australian soldier farmer waged unconventional war horde emu large flightless bird destroying crop livestock western australia great emu war dubbed military failure public embarrassment australian government soldier armed machine gun truck proved ineffective fast agile emu scattered regrouped emu remarkable ability survive bullet reported taken shot falling soldier managed kill emu estimated war ended week emu declared victor,"[('military', [5, 2]), ('war', [2, 5]), ('week', [6, 5]), ('shot', [6, 2]), ('group', [6, 4]), ('taken', [4, 5]), ('failure', [4, 6]), ('armed', [5, 2]), ('kill', [2, 5]), ('government', [4, 2]), ('remarkable', [5, 6]), ('bullet', [4]), ('embarrassment', [4]), ('great', [6, 5]), ('public', [4, 5]), ('gun', [5, 4]), ('reported', [4, 6]), ('ended', [6, 5]), ('ability', [4, 6]), ('machine', [4, 6]), ('australian', [4]), ('estimated', [6, 8]), ('large', [6, 2]), ('truck', [5]), ('destroying', [2, 4]), ('soldier', [5, 2]), ('survive', [2, 8]), ('managed', [6]), ('falling', [2, 4]), ('australia', [7]), ('fast', [6, 8]), ('western', [2, 8]), ('ineffective', [5]), ('waged', [4, 7]), ('victor', [6]), ('declared', [6, 4]), ('farmer', [8]), ('crop', [8]), ('proved', [6, 2]), ('bird', [4, 8]), ('dubbed', [6]), ('unconventional', [6]), ('emu', [6]), ('livestock', [8]), ('horde', [2]), ('agile', [2, 6]), ('flightless', [6, 2]), ('regrouped', [6, 2]), ('scattered', [6, 2])]","[('military', ['Border/community/family', 'War']), ('war', ['War', 'Border/community/family']), ('week', ['Election/debate', 'Border/community/family']), ('shot', ['Election/debate', 'War']), ('group', ['Election/debate', 'Republicans vs democrats']), ('taken', ['Republicans vs democrats', 'Border/community/family']), ('failure', ['Republicans vs democrats', 'Election/debate']), ('armed', ['Border/community/family', 'War']), ('kill', ['War', 'Border/community/family']), ('government', ['Republicans vs democrats', 'War']), ('remarkable', ['Border/community/family', 'Election/debate']), ('bullet', ['Republicans vs democrats']), ('embarrassment', ['Republicans vs democrats']), ('great', ['Election/debate', 'Border/community/family']), ('public', ['Republicans vs democrats', 'Border/community/family']), ('gun', ['Border/community/family', 'Republicans vs democrats']), ('reported', ['Republicans vs democrats', 'Election/debate']), ('ended', ['Election/debate', 'Border/community/family']), ('ability', ['Republicans vs democrats', 'Election/debate']), ('machine', ['Republicans vs democrats', 'Election/debate']), ('australian', ['Republicans vs democrats']), ('estimated', ['Election/debate', 'Infrastructure/job/energy']), ('large', ['Election/debate', 'War']), ('truck', ['Border/community/family']), ('destroying', ['War', 'Republicans vs democrats']), ('soldier', ['Border/community/family', 'War']), ('survive', ['War', 'Infrastructure/job/energy']), ('managed', ['Election/debate']), ('falling', ['War', 'Republicans vs democrats']), ('australia', ['Abortion/rights/guns']), ('fast', ['Election/debate', 'Infrastructure/job/energy']), ('western', ['War', 'Infrastructure/job/energy']), ('ineffective', ['Border/community/family']), ('waged', ['Republicans vs democrats', 'Abortion/rights/guns']), ('victor', ['Election/debate']), ('declared', ['Election/debate', 'Republicans vs democrats']), ('farmer', ['Infrastructure/job/energy']), ('crop', ['Infrastructure/job/energy']), ('proved', ['Election/debate', 'War']), ('bird', ['Republicans vs democrats', 'Infrastructure/job/energy']), ('dubbed', ['Election/debate']), ('unconventional', ['Election/debate']), ('emu', ['Election/debate']), ('livestock', ['Infrastructure/job/energy']), ('horde', ['War']), ('agile', ['War', 'Election/debate']), ('flightless', ['Election/debate', 'War']), ('regrouped', ['Election/debate', 'War']), ('scattered', ['Election/debate', 'War'])]"
