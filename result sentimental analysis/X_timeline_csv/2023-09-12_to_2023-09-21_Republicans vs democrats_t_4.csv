Joe obstructed that investigation. According to Ken Buck and his new friends in the Democrat Party media, this is not evidence of anything. Joe Biden spoke to an untold number of Hunter's foreign clients, including top officials with ties to the Communist Party regime in China, but this, according to Ken Buck and his new friends in the Democrat Party, is not evidence of anything. Hunter took an untold number of trips with Joe on Air Force II where he met with numerous foreign officials in countries and with governments in which Hunter was doing business or wanted to do business. According to Ken Buck and his new friends in the Democrat Pary, so what? Joe Biden knew, as a matter of fact, that Hunter was representing officially or even unofficially numerous foreign businesses. That's more than enough to be required to register under FARA. Therefore, Joe Biden assisted his son in violating FARA, which does not require a payment of any kind and is not a specific intent crime -- a co-conspirator. Joe Biden's staff and Hunter's business associates were in constant contact. I guess they were just buddies. And there's a ton more. Of course, for impeachment purposes, you do not require evidence of a crime under the criminal code. Ken Buck might not know this but there was no federal criminal code when the Constitution was ratified. Nor is there a requirement of the kind of evidence required to convict in a courtroom, or a ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" standard. But let's be clear, the list of Joe Biden impeachment issues that I quickly assembled here is far, far more compelling than any information that was brought against Donald Trump. He neither blackmailed the president of the Ukraine (Zelensky said he was not), Biden did; nor did he commit high crimes or misdemeanors on January 6, when there was no House inquiry, just a railroad job by the House Democrats (with support from a mere 10 Republicans), a quick vote, followed by a Stalinist trial (while Trump was a private citizen), in which Trump was found innocent. As for Kevin McCarthy not taking a vote of the House to initiate an impeachment inquiry, Nancy Pelosi set the precedent for this. The sword cuts both ways, and in this case it certainly should. As an aside, Matt Gaetz is whining all the time, this time that McCarthy was too slow or whatever. Actually, his beef is with Jim Jordan, James Comer, Jason Smith, the three investigative committee chairmen who've specifically said they need time to build a preliminary case before an impeachment

VIETNAM: Biden began the week with a 30+ minute meltdown in Vietnam, where he took a handful of pre-written questions from pre-selected reporters in a “press conference” that more closely resembled the ramblings of a madman. Then, he announced he was “going to bed.” 9/11: He then returned to the United States, where he became the first president in 22 years to mark the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks not at an attack site. Instead, Biden delivered brief remarks during a refueling stop in Alaska, where he falsely claimed to have visited Ground Zero “the next day” — which didn’t happen. IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY: On Tuesday, Speaker Kevin McCarthy directed House committees to begin a formal impeachment inquiry into Biden over allegations of influence peddling, corruption, and abuse of power — and Americans largely support it. In fact, 59 percent of Americans are “concerned about whether Joe Biden committed wrongdoing related to his son Hunter Biden’s business dealings,” including 65 percent of independents. BIDENFLATION: On Wednesday, news broke that inflation surged to 3.7 percent year-over-year in August — “hotter than expected” and more than twice the rate it was when Biden took office — as the Biden administration continues its streak of being wrong on inflation every step of the way. INDICTMENT: Hunter Biden was indicted on felony gun charges, just weeks after a sweetheart plea deal from Biden’s DOJ fell apart under basic scrutiny from a federal judge — and more charges are likely coming. BIDENOMICS: On Thursday, Biden attempted to sell his failed “Bidenomics” agenda with a speech in Maryland. Instead, Biden filled the speech with outlandish promises, made-up stories, and casual racism. KAMALA: Everyone knows Kamala Harris is a liability — and this week, the dam apparently broke. Democrat Reps. Nancy Pelosi and Jamie Raskin didn’t hold back, refusing — repeatedly — to throw their unwavering support behind Harris. STRIKE: Biden, who fancies himself the “most pro-union president” in history, couldn’t stop the United Auto Workers from striking — even though he said it wouldn’t happen. “I don’t know what [Biden] has done,” said one local UAW president. With weeks like these, is anyone surprised 70 percent of Americans say things are going BADLY under Biden?

Here’s why - First, almost every Presidential candidate in the Republican Party has claimed to be a “Christian”. It’s as if this a required political status, rather than a deep and true commitment of the soul. While many have been legit, many have also blatantly used the name of Jesus to benefit their campaigns and coffers. True. Next, saying you’re a “Christian” doesn’t mean jack. Good grief @BillClinton, with his countless scandals, and Climate Cultist @algore were the first Southern Baptists to serve as President and VP. @BarackObama still fights for abortion up to birth, also claimed to be a Christian. And @JoeBiden has naked trans folks on the White House lawn who were they by his invitation, but he’s lifelong a Catholic. So there’s that. Finally, Vivek shares my conservative political values, not only because of his Hindu faith, but because he is guided by love, optimism, and the idea that good should prevail. Whether Vivek’s being yelled at during a town hall or fiercely questioned by a far left reporter, video after video is proof of Vivek’s patience, willingness to value EVERYONE, and exemplifies the story of his fierce foundations in the truth. To my brothers and sisters in Jesus - Don’t be brainwashed by those who claim to be a “Christian” for what may only be political purposes. Don’t be coerced by their labels. The stakes are too high in this election, and we need Vivek as our 47th President.

Both have worked at the IRS for over a decade on some of the biggest tax crime cases in our country’s history. What they witnessed while working on the Hunter Biden criminal investigation was a “corrosion of ethical standards and the abuse of power that threaten our nation.” They have brought forward serious allegations of politicization and misconduct by DOJ officials. In short, these are good people who did everything right to obtain whistleblower protection with the best interest of our country in mind. Meanwhile, Hunter Biden is a tax cheat who hasn’t paid his fair share – something that @POTUS lectures everyday Americans about.

The timing could not be any worse for Giuliani as he is currently drowning financially. For example, on the day he was arraigned in Georgia he was seen leaving a bail bonds office — indicating that he is likely dead broke. The law firm Davidoff Hutcher & Citron alleges that Giuliani has only paid $214,000 of the money he owes them for numerous services, including helping him with the January 6th investigation, 2021 investigations by Georgia prosecutors, and numerous other problems. Despite his massive outstanding bill of $1,360,196, Giuliani's most recent payment to the firm was made four days ago and was for the relatively paltry sum of $10,000, meaning he hardly made a dent. Giuliani's spokesman Ted Goodman pathetically whined about the lawsuit on Giuliani's behalf— ""I can’t express how personally hurt I am by what Bob Costello has done. It’s a real shame when lawyers do things like this, and all I will say is that their bill is way in excess to anything approaching legitimate fees,"" he said."" The man once known as ""America's mayor"" is well and truly cooked. The good news for Rudy is that meals in prison are free.

The prince sat down for an interview with Fox News host Bret Baier asked him directly about the money, which was clearly payback for the huge favors Kushner did for the Saudis while he was in the White House. Not only did the Trump administration give massive weapons deals to Saudi Arabia, they ignored the kingdom's brutal murder and dismemberment of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. ""In the Trump administration, you had a really close relationship with the president's senior advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner,"" said Baier. ""After he left, Saudi fund made reportedly a two billion dollar investment in Jared's new fund he was launching and managing."" ""Do you think that sends the wrong message even if there wasn't a tit for tat, an 'I'll give you this and you get that'?"" asked Baier. ""We look to opportunities and investment,"" said bin Salman. ""We have a lot of investment around the globe with a lot of peoples and with economic opportunity."" ""So if Trump becomes president again you'll leave the two billion with Jared Kushner?"" asked Baier. ""It's a commitment that PIF [Public Investment Fund, the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia] have and when PIF have commitment with any investor around the globe, they keep it,"" said the prince. In other words, if Donald Trump wins reelection the Saudis will be able to directly exploit the massive sum of money they gave to his son-in-law to influence American foreign policy — even more than the already have. ""Would it affect your decisions with a new Trump administration with that sitting there?"" asked Baier. ""Well... Saudi Arabia is so big so I'm quite sure mostly any person around the world directly or indirectly you have something to do with Saudi Arabia,"" said bin Salman. ""So if that can affect President Trump's decision if he becomes a president that mean it can affect every president in the world and every person in the world's decision because directly or indirectly they have some sort of interest or something to do with Saudi Arabia,"" the prince added. In other words, Saudi economic corruption is a powerful global force that affects more than just Donald Trump and Jared Kushner. Crucially, bin Salman did NOT deny the fact that he influences both men. A vote for Donald Trump is a vote to give Saudi Arabia total control over the U.S. government and its military.
