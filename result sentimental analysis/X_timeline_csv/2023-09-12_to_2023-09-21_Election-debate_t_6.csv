How do fresh new ideas ‚Äì and traditional ideals like freedom and unity ‚Äì break through? Through caring citizens like you ‚Äì via national polling. I have already qualified for the next Republican debate on Sept. 27 in terms of fundraising. Now I only need 3% support at the polls to step onto that stage ‚Äì which is why I‚Äôm asking you this favor‚Ä¶ If a pollster calls you, please say: ‚ÄúI support Ryan Binkley for President.‚Äù I‚Äôm a CEO of a private investment bank with a deep understanding of the financial storm looming over our nation. I‚Äôm a pastor who knows division, hatred, and discontentment with each other have brought us to a place of brokenness in our culture. We need an economic revival and a spiritual revival. The time for that revival is now. I have a plan (https://t.co/h2a1V7bUd7 ) to move us off dependence on debt and into prosperity with a balanced budget, healthcare reform, growth tax policies, deregulation, and energy independence. I have a message of unity, service, and ‚ÄúLove your neighbor‚Äù to bring us back together so we can move forward into the greatest days of our nation, days that are still to come. Over the next days, answer your phone (pollsters may be calling), and be ready to say, ‚ÄúI support Ryan Binkley for President‚Äù. #Believe2024 #Binkley2024",united state america great thing
