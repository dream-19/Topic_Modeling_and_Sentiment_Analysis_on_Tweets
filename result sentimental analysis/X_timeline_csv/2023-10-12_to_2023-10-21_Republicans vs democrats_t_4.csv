Earlier tonight, the group that invaded Israel, massacred 1000+ people, burned families to death in their homes, took hostages back to Gaza, and recorded it all with GoPros – this group announced that Israel bombed a hospital in Gaza, killing hundreds. Then, instead of waiting for more information from the Israeli side, the editors of the world's most important media outlets said to themselves: ""This is enough for us. Let's run with it."" Headlines screamed that Israel bombed a hospital. Push notifications were sent to MILLIONS of people. CNN push: ""Hundreds of people may have been killed in an Israeli strike on a Gaza City hospital, according to the Palestinian health ministry"" BBC push: ""Hundreds feared dead or injured in Israeli air strike on hospital in Gaza, Palestinian officials say"" NYT push: ""At least 500 people were killed by an Israeli airstrike at a Gaza hospital, the Palestinian Health Ministry said"" Do you see what they did there? They put the dramatic news in the beginning of the sentence and then they cited the source at the end so that the assertion is technically true. The Palestinian Health Ministry DID say that. The thing is, the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza is a Hamas institution. What do you call people who amplify Hamas propaganda not just as news, but as the top news story in the world? There is no way that a professional military such as the Israel Defense Forces can give an instant answer about a catastrophe in enemy territory during a war. It took around two or three hours for the IDF to share the results of its initial investigation – that the explosion at the hospital was a due to a rocket launched by Islamic Jihad that malfunctioned and crashed back into Gaza. More evidence is coming out as I write this. The sad fact is that it appears that hundreds of Palestinians are dead at a hospital because terrorists in Gaza tried to fire rockets at Israelis and ended up hitting their own people. It's unbearably stupid and tragic. None of this is new, unfortunately. Journalists in the Middle East know – they absolutely know – that a significant percentage of Hamas and Islamic Jihad’s rockets misfire and crash into residential areas of Gaza. I've attached a famous example. This video is from May 2022. It shows a live broadcast of a rocket being launched from a residential area of Gaza. The rocket malfunctions, turns sideways, and crashes into the city. The overexcited broadcaster tries to pretend that nothing unusual happened and asks the camera man to turn away. The video went viral at the time. There are other known instances where this happened. These rockets are designed to kill people. Don't act surprised when they do. I say all of this to remind you to treat breaking news from Gaza with caution, even if it's unpopular to do so.",story news industry work earlier tonight group invaded israel massacred people burned

On June 29, 2023, Robert Malley was placed on unpaid leave from his role as Joe Biden's special envoy to Iran, and his security clearance was suspended due to an ongoing investigation into the potential mishandling of classified materials. On September 29, 2023, Semafor reported that Malley was involved in funding, supporting, and directing an Iranian intelligence operation to influence the United States and allied governments, as revealed by a collection of Iranian government emails. These emails suggested that Malley facilitated the placement of an Iranian agent of influence named Ariane Tabatabai in sensitive positions within the U.S. government, initially at the State Department and later at the Pentagon, where she has been serving as Chief of Staff for the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations. On October 16, 2023, Revolver News reported that Maher Bitar, who is Senior Director for Intelligence Programs on Joe Biden’s National Security Council, was also an executive director of the “Students for Justice in Palestine” group that reportedly responded to the recent Hamas terror attack on Israel by organizing a “Day of Resistance” in support of Hamas’ “historic win” against Israel. Bitar was photographed wearing a black and white “keffiyeh,” a symbol of Palestinian nationalism, and standing in front of a sign that reads, “Divest from Israel Apartheid.” Kash Patel has pointed out that Maher Bitar plays a significant role in determining intelligence prioritization for President Biden, even though there is a photo of him wearing Palestinian attire, calling for the economic and political boycott of Israel. Robert Malley, who recently had his security clearance suspended by the FBI, installed Ariane Tabatabai at the Department of Defense as the Assistant Chief of Staff for the Special Operations Office.

It’s time for a third option. Here’s why: First of all, forget about polls, they haven’t been trustworthy for years. For all of the Trump supporters out there, I ask you to take a step back and take off your orange colored glasses. The Democratic Party absolutely wants Donald Trump on the ballot. He is the only candidate they can beat and they know it. Back in March of this year Trump was ahead of DeSantis by 4 points for the Republican nomination. ""Magically"", the first indictment against him came out in March and his lead began to grow. You might think it was a miscalculation by democrats, but it wasn’t. If it had been, they would not have followed it up with three more indictments, further solidifying Trump’s nomination. How do the Democrats know they can beat Trump, you may ask? Because Trump brings out their vote like nothing else. Most people that vote against Trump are voting at an emotional level not a political one. Democrats also have the advantage of being organized at the ground level and understanding ballot harvesting. They will make sure their voters are registered and make sure they get their ballots sent in. As usual Republicans will rely on in-person voting which will limit participation. So regardless of the current polls, Trump will lose. Why shouldn’t Joe Biden win? First of all, he is not physically or mentally capable to hold the office. His mental decline is quite obvious even among democrats. While important, that is not the most important reason. Regardless of what you think of Biden, either positive or negative, if he wins he will preside over the fall of the United States as we know it. When Biden beats Trump again the divide that already exists in this country will become too large to bridge. Rightly or wrongly half of this country will decide the election was stolen and will seek retribution. We will not have a peaceful national divorce, we will have a violent civil war. This is not hyperbole, it will be January 6, 2021 times 100. I am not suggesting that we should let Donald Trump win. Far from it. It's time for Americans to break away from the divisive two-party system and consider alternative options. One such option is a libertarian candidate like myself. The libertarian philosophy prioritizes individual rights and limited government intervention. This perspective could serve as a middle ground between the perceived governmental overreach criticized by conservatives and the personal freedoms championed by liberals. By focusing on personal liberty and fiscal responsibility, as a libertarian candidate, I could bridge the current divide, appealing to Americans who feel disenfranchised by the current system and offer a vision of unity that transcends party lines. For a nation yearning for stability and unity, turning towards a third option, like myself, a libertarian, is exactly the fresh start the U.S. needs.",donald trump win joe biden time option forget

At every level, every single day, the pure of heart patriots are finding themselves elevated, exalted, and protected. It's easy to get dragged into the darkness when you're inundated with horrific news and propaganda. In the backdrop of this surface level, chaos and fear is the meteoric rise in the polls of President Donald J Trump and his America first disciples. The American electorate is not only yearning for a true champion, but they're slowly becoming impervious to lies and gas lighting about President Trump. Victor Hugo once stated, ""There is nothing more powerful than an idea whose time has come."" President Trump, his vision and policies are that idea. This isn't about campaigning, advertising, convincing, or selling him as a candidate. Hearts in America are changing, and with that change, it is the realization that we need Trump leading us. This is why the news attacks elevate him. There isn't enough donor money in the world to stop him. And why God does not recognize nor have concern for corrupt court rooms and partisan judges. President Trump and his movement will only be judged by the highest of courts, and at this time, it's obvious that he's being vindicated.
