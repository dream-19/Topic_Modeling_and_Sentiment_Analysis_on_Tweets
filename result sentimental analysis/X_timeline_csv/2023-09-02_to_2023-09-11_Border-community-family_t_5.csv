They were meant to piss people off. 9/11 was a turning point for the entire world, not just the USA. Unjust wars, unjust wire taps, torture, imprisonment of the innocent, and the rise of an out-of-control surveillance state. The American people rallied behind the lies of the Bush administration, destabilizing an entire region which lead to the rise of ISIS. Nearly 500,000 people died in Iraq because of a lie that was pushed about ""weapons of mass destruction,"" of which Bush himself would admit that there wasn't any. ""Whoops, my bad."" 9/11 should really piss people off - not just because of how many Americans died in 2001, but because it nailed the coffin shut on any freedoms the USA ever had. There was a time when the USA didn't have cameras watching your every movement. There was a time when the USA wasn't allowed to unlawfully surveil it's own citizens. The Bush lies made it easy for the Trump lies to take root. One very hard fact for people to swallow is that Obama could have very easily gone after the Bush administration for war crimes, and instead of perpetuating the war in the Middle East, he could have resolved it. Instead, Obama became known as the president that droned the fuck out of innocent families. Only later to take the title of ""I caught Osama Bin Ladin but dumped his body in the ocean."" The conspiracies from the right wing are constantly fueled. From the 9/11 truther movement, to the anti-vax Covid-19 truther movement, to the anti-maskers - to the Sandy Hook shootings being a staged event: it's a slap in the face to logical reasoning and common sense. In a lot of ways, 9/11 lead up to why we have two ancient relics running for office, one far right-wing dictator and an ancient centrist who is trying to act progressive. So - go ahead and mourn not just the loss of those 2,996 souls who died on September 11, 2001 - mourn for the loss of the innocents who were obliterated because of the lies of Bush, and the perpetuation of the unjust wars by Obama too.
