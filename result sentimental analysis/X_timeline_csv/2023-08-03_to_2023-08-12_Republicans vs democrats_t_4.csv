The Biden administration has created a legal morass never seen or experienced in American history, as applies to a presidential election. The attorney general, appointed by the Democrat president, is authorizing indictment after indictment of his president's possible if not likely political opponent in the middle of a presidential election cycle. He is doing so through his appointment of a special counsel, whose appointment was a misapplication of the special counsel regulation, and whose charges must be approved by the attorney general. (By the way, as an important side issue, Jack Smith is not a presidential appointee; he never even stood for confirmation by the Senate to hold the position he holds and to exercise the authority he is exercising against a party opponent.) It should be noted at the same time, the attorney general refuses to appoint an outside special counsel to investigate his client, Joe Biden, despite the fact that the DOJ regulation was originally instituted for these exact circumstances. Of course, this underscores the purpose and motive of what is taking place before us today. The attorney general is approving the timing of dozens of charges against the former Republican president, who is actively seeking his party's nomination to challenge the Democrat president for whom he directly reports, which are intended to cripple the ability of Donald Trump to effectively run for president, regardless of what polls show today. And regardless of what the commentariat say, and despite President Trump's strength within the Republican Party, the outcome of the election is unknown. Therefore, the polls are irrelevant in this regard. Moreover, as further evidence that these indictments are being used as political weapons are the timing of the charges -- specifically, all of these charges by the separate grand juries, all controlled by the special counsel, should have been filed AFTER the election, as there was no possibility the statute of limitations would run on any of them. Further, the special counsel repeatedly insists that the charges must be quickly adjudicated, meaning before the people vote, for the purpose of having maximum influence on the election. In addition, the charges have resulted in the significant depletion of Trump's campaign funds to pay for millions in legal fees. Trump has to take significant time from campaigning to address the dozens of charges dropped on him by the Biden administration -- that is, he has to expend an enormous amount of time working with his lawyers in order to defend himself from charges that, collectively, would result in his imprisonment until his death. The fact is that this kind of legal warfare against a presidential and possible if not likely opponent to the present president, is not only unprecedented in the history of our republic it will destroy our electoral system for all time. It is not something that should left to various district courts or local courts to sort out in the course of regular judicial proceedings. In fact, that is part of the intended strategy by the prosecutors who are engaged in this assault on our electoral system. They must not be rewarded for their behavior. They must not be rewarded for their treachery and exploitation of the legal system and the courts to achieve their political ends. Even without getting to the merits of these multitude of charges, which are easily unraveled from my perspective, the process is what is being used to interfere with the election. And the near silence by those who are orchestrating this shocking legal warfare, when the American people are left in the dark, is untenable. Therefore, I want to publicly encourage the Trump legal team to seek an emergency hearing before the U.S. Supreme Court, not to resolve legal disputes, but to at least temporarily halt the abomination of this legal warfare that is unfolding in front of us -- where Democrats and anti-Trump Republicans are unashamedly celebrating the use of the courts by the Biden administration and Democrat DA's to further their political wishes, as the rest of the nation watches in shock.

Perhaps the way forward is for President Trump's attorneys in the Florida document case to appeal the lower court's ruling for a trial start date in May to the circuit court making, in part, the arguments I discussed on air last night and below on this site. Make an emergency appeal to the circuit court, since what's being raised is the government's efforts in using the courts and the judicial process as tools to deny Trump his constitutional right to effectively defend himself and his freedom, and conduct his campaign for president at the same time. He is unable to do both effectively at the same time. The government is interfering with both and doing so knowingly. These cases can be pursued after the election, as there is no statute of limitations issue (recall, Garland purposefully let a statute of limitations run in the Hunter Biden tax case; here, there is no running of statutes of limitations if the cases are put off until after the election. Hard to see how DOJ can square any argument they'd make in opposition). The Biden administration is knowingly forcing this issue by the manner in which it is litigating for the purpose of creating these extraordinary and unprecedented circumstances. Garland, who has signed off on every indictment brought against Trump in the federal cases, should not be able to deny anyone their constitutional right to due process and an effective defense; nor should he be able to interfere this way in the ability of a candidate for president to conduct his campaign, by the manner, date, and time in which he decides to bring these indictments. Garland must not be free to control court procedures like he is currently doing. Garland is playing the system and the judges ought not put up with it. The activist judges, of course, such as the DC judge, are undoubtedly happy to play along. The fact is that Trump cannot effectively defend himself and run for president at the same time. He ought not be forced to decide between one or the other, either. Meanwhile, every day that goes by effects the election. His campaign funds are having to be used to defend against these politically timed indictments, and his time campaigning undoubtedly been limited due to the time needed to confer with his lawyers and make court appearances. This was all predictable when Garland unleashed these cases and timed them for maximum damage to Trump personally and his campaign. The legal and judicial systems must not allow themselves to be used this way. In short, the judiciary must also defend itself from such devious manipulations. I have no faith in any of the judges in DC. They have lost our respect. Too many are political activists who have rubber stamped everything the DOJ and Garland-Smith have sought. I have greater faith in the court in Florida. Regardless, individual district court judges ought not decide for the nation how we shall now proceed, given what the Biden DOJ has foisted in the nation. This matter needs to get to SCOTUS. Hopefully, an appeal from the May court date will do it. It's not a slam dunk and the ultimate outcome isn't either.

As recently as late last year, Mr. Biden confided to his inner circle that he believed former President Donald J. Trump was a threat to democracy and should be prosecuted, according to two people familiar with his comments.

Now, the judge is taking it upon herself to ask about it. The DOJ guidelines for prosecutors are as clear as can be -- grand jury investigations are to occur in the district where the relevant events are alleged to have taken place. You can't look for grand juries in districts where you think are most beneficial to the government, and then move the case to the relevant jurisdiction claiming superseding indictments or whatever. The grand jury in Florida did not actually hear from the witnesses or participate in the investigation. This DOJ rule exists for a very important reason, and Jack Smith, yet again, cut corners in a way that should result in the dismissal of the entire case. In DC, Smith, again, cut off discussions about Trump's access to information that is to be used in a trial, using the absurd claim that his social media post was grounds for withholding the information from him. Not only is that ridiculous, but Smith files his protective order Friday night, gets a hearing Monday, after cutting off the discussions with Trump's lawyers about his demand that Trump now have access to key information. This is the same Smith who succeeded with another Obama judge in violation Trump's attorney-client privilege due process rights in the documents case in from the same grand jury that should not have even been involved in the documents case (see above).

Rather, White House officials were simply expressing their free speech rights, and Facebook executives were free to ignore White House requests. But newly released internal emails show that Facebook executives felt pressure to comply with White House demands in order to resolve a European Union ban on the social media company’s ability to transfer the data of European users to its servers in the United States. In July 2021, after a White House official demanded that Facebook censor more information, Facebook’s Vice President of Global Affairs and Communications, Nick Clegg, asked his colleagues to comply. The reason? Because of “the bigger fish we have to fry with the Administration — data flows etc…” ￼ By “data flows,” Clegg was referring to the EU’s demand that Facebook stop transferring European user data — which Facebook advertisers value for targeting customers — to the United States. The dispute was no small matter. In May of this year, EU regulators fined Meta, Facebook’s parent company, a record $1.3 billion for breaking the EU’s privacy regulations. The regulator said that Meta had violated a 2020 ruling by the EU’s highest court. Two months later, on July 10, 2023, the Biden Administration and European Union announced a deal, the “EU-US Data Privacy Framework.” The series of events suggests a quid pro quo. Facebook would bow to White House requests for censorship in exchange for its help with the European Union. “This is a gross violation of the First Amendment,” Columbia Law School Professor Philip Hamburger told Public, “not only because it involves what the Supreme Court considers ‘coercion,’ but also because it’s equally unconstitutional for the government to seek censorship through contract or conspiracy. And that’s what happened here.” The White House wasn’t the only entity demanding that Facebook censor. NGOs and journalists from NBC and the New York Times were also pressuring Facebook to censor more. In response, Facebook executives weighed the radical “blackholing” measure, which blocks links to external web sites without informing users. But it’s clear from the newly released emails that Facebook executives felt the greatest pressure from the White House and that they feared the White House would hurt them in other ways. Until now, critics of government demands for greater Facebook censorship have focused on the White House’s threat to revoke Facebook’s Section 230 status, which immunizes the company from many forms of liability. But the new emails point to a form of government leverage over the platform that has been ignored until now: the EU demand on Facebook to stop data flows from the EU to the US, and the conditional willingness of the White House to push back against it. A potential end of EU-to-US data flows is an even more urgent threat to Facebook’s business than White House threats to Section 230. About ten percent of Facebook’s total global advertising revenue, $1.2 billion, comes from selling ads in the EU. While neither Congress nor the Biden Administration have shown much willingness to follow through on their threats to modify Section 230, the European Union has imposed fine after fine on Meta/Facebook. Last November, EU regulators fined Meta $291 million for a leak of its data. And in January of this year, they fined Meta $429 billion for making users accept personalized ads in order to use Facebook. All of which raises the question: why did EU leaders cut a deal with the Biden White House to allow Meta to move data to the United States?

That's why he is on his own egomaniacal public tour, doing press everywhere and anywhere trashing the former president and, mostly, giving aid and comfort to Garland and Smith.

Pence first fought the grand jury subpoena. After he was forced to testify and provide his notes (which he took in secret), now he tries to position himself as some great hero.

I wasn’t referring to the baseless theories about controlled demolitions at buildings around the World Trade Center, but the very real possibility supported by recently declassified documents that al-Qaida’s attack was undertaken with support from Saudi intelligence officials. Apparently, that breached a third rail of American politics. Democrat Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut tweeted: 'If you want to be the GOP presidential nominee, you need to believe the government blew up the Twin Towers, and Osama bin Laden is an innocent man who’s living under an alias in Miami.' Former Vice President Pence said he was 'deeply offended' that I don’t trust that the government told us the full truth in the 9/11 Commission Report. The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board pages mocked me for wading into “fever swamps” and were appalled that a presidential candidate 'really just said that,' quipping that “back on planet Earth, the 9/11 Commission was one of the better efforts at government accountability in recent memory and its findings have never been discredited by anyone credible.” Hold on there. Back on the real planet Earth, the FBI declassified documents in 2021 which reveal that the 9/11 Commission flatly lied about potential Saudi government involvement in the attacks. Yes, it’s in our national interest to move on from 9/11 and to preserve a stable relationship with Saudi Arabia – but our best chance of rebuilding public trust is to acknowledge the truth about one of the defining events in our nation’s history. A key question confronted by the 9/11 Commission was whether the Saudi government was involved in planning the attacks. The report concluded there was neither Saudi government nor royal family involvement. At the time, questions swirled around a 42-year-old graduate student who welcomed, housed, set-up bank accounts, and gave rent money to the first two Qaida hijackers after they landed in Los Angeles in January 2000 – concerns which the FBI and 9/11 Commission flatly dismissed. The Saudi student, Omar al-Bayoumi, claimed to have met the two terrorists entirely by chance; The 9/11 Commission report verified that Bayoumi’s altruism was in the name of hospitality as he claimed. And FBI official, Jacqueline Maguire, testified to the 9/11 Commission in 2004 that Bayoumi’s first meeting at a café with the hijackers appeared to be “a random encounter.” This is all against the backdrop of a 1998 FBI investigation revealing that rather than attend graduate school as he purported, Bayoumi frequented local mosques, doling out money for various causes and frequently and conspicuously videotaped visitors. The “graduate student” reportedly put up $400,000 to start a mosque in San Diego and all the while was paid a stipend and other expenses as a ghost employee of a Saudi contracting company, the FBI reported. Notwithstanding these facts, both the FBI and the 9/11 Commission emphatically supported Bayoumi’s account. Now over 20 years later, the FBI has changed its story. In documents declassified last year, the bureau affirmed that Bayoumi was in fact an agent of the Saudi intelligence service who worked with Saudi religious officials and reported to the kingdom’s powerful ambassador in Washington. These revelations are now the focal point in a long-running federal lawsuit in New York, where 9/11 survivors and relatives of the 2,977 people who were killed are seeking to hold the Saudi government responsible for the attacks. Even if the media doesn’t want to litigate the case against the Saudi government, these survivors and family members are – and understandably so. There are reasons to believe that successive U.S. administrations hid the Bayoumi revelations to provide public cover to the CIA for critical failures in the lead-up to 9/11. The two Saudis, Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi, were known to the CIA as al-Qaida operatives. The CIA was watching as they joined an al-Qaida planning meeting in Malaysia in early January 2000. But the agency reportedly lost track of the two when they flew on to Bangkok and then to Los Angeles on Jan. 15, 2000. Embarrassingly, the CIA did not alert the FBI for more than a year after it learned the terrorists had entered the United States using their real names and Saudi passports. Given the enduring mystery over how the CIA lost track of Hazmi and Mihdhar in Malaysia, former FBI investigators have speculated that Bayoumi might have been asked to approach the hijackers as part of a U.S. or Saudi intelligence operation to recruit them. At the time, former officials have said, the CIA was trying desperately to develop sources inside al-Qaida. The CIA has consistently denied that it allowed the hijackers to come into the United States as part of a failed recruitment effort. Former White House counterterrorism coordinator, Richard Clarke, cited this as a plausible explanation for the CIA’s failure to track the first two hijackers and its abiding refusal to alert the FBI to their presence in the United States. The government hasn’t done itself any favors since then to build public trust around 9/11 or the U.S. response to it. The Pentagon’s prevarications about celebrity soldier Pat Tillman’s death in Afghanistan – initially claiming he was shot by enemy forces, but later forced to admit that he was killed by friendly fire – is one undisputed case among many. These events are important foremost because U.S. government officials continue to lie about other matters of public importance – the origin of Covid-19, knowledge about UAPs, Hunter Biden’s laptop, and so on – with a complicit media that just accepts the prevailing narrative without question. This fuels rampant public distrust. There is no credible evidence that 9/11 was an 'inside job,' but ironically when the government systematically lies about Saudi involvement and the media runs interference, that lends plausibility to an otherwise nonsensical claim. There’s no such thing as a noble lie. The reason the people don’t trust the government is because the government doesn’t trust the people.

A redacted police report claims that Muskegon, MI City Clerk Ann Meisch encountered a woman dropping off 8,000 - 10,000 completed voter registration applications. As detailed by @gatewaypundit, the “registrations included the same handwriting, non-existent addresses, and incorrect phone numbers.” An investigation found that the woman worked for GBI Strategies. As noted by @KanekoaTheGreat, dark money super PAC ‘BlackPAC’ paid GBI Strategies $11,254,919 to register voters for Joe Biden. The police then searched the office of GBI where they found “semiautomatic guns, silencers/suppressors, burner phones, a bag of pre-paid cash cards, and incomplete registrations, in an office space that was styled as an eyeglasses store that had gone defunct.” No arrests were made. While speaking with Steve Bannon, Kloster recalled the events and claimed “there were standing orders not to deal with election matters.” “There were standing orders not to deal with election matters, both from the White House Council and from Barr. I happened to know Barr’s Chief of Staff, Will Levi, because I had worked at Heritage and ran into him at a lunch basically for Senate staffers.” “I called him up and tried to put the flag up into the voting rights section, CRD-DOJ and White House Counsel in a couple different places and got stiff-armed. And then later on hear from Johnny and others that basically then the White House counsel swoops in and starts screaming, ‘what the hell are you guys doing?’ So that’s really the nuts and bolts of

As we watch the U.S. Embassy evacuation in Kabul and see images of the Taliban taking control of the country, to those of us who fought there it is more than a strategic failure; it’s personal.” “This year, for the first time in U.S. history, one could have joined the military, served for twenty years, and retired while the country is still involved in the same war.” “In what is accurately described as imperial hubris, the United States political-military establishment confused entry and initial resolve with victory. They were wrong; America’s sons and daughters paid the price.” “Simply put, our elected officials and senior level military leaders were trapped by their own intellectual inertia, condemning us to eventual defeat.” “Strategically, our leaders were not held to account for their blunders — in too many cases, blunders of epic proportions. Rather, they were promoted and eventually retired with full pensions to sit on the boards of companies making a killing in the world of government contracts; the military industrial complex is alive and well.

Paul Yingling pointed out in his 2007 article A Failure in Generalship, ‘As matters stand now, a private who loses a rifle suffers far greater consequences than a general who loses a war.’” • Study

If it wasn't for MI City Clerk Ann Meisch who caught the woman dropping off these ballots, they would have likely been added to the state's voter rolls. Just imagine how many voter registrations were not caught in swing states... On Friday, Detroit News confirmed @gatewaypundit's reporting on the development. A redacted police report describes how Meisch encountered a woman dropping off 8,000 - 10,000 completed voter registration applications. The @gatewaypundit reported that the “registrations included the same handwriting, non-existent addresses, and incorrect phone numbers.” An investigation found that the woman worked for GBI Strategies. GBI Strategies was funded by dark money super PAC ‘BlackPAC,’ who paid them $11,254,919 to register voters for Joe Biden. Upon further investigation, the police found guns, burner phones, pre-paid cash cards and incomplete registrations at a defunct eyeglass store where GBI Strategies had set up operation. There was plenty of fraud in the 2020 election. The problem was that people in positions of power didn't want to find it.
