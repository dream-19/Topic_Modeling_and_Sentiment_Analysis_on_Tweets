Here's the full response I received from CAHN's Executive Director Evan Balgord: The far-right movement sees itself as the true people fighting against a corrupt ruling class. (Nothing wrong with that first part. Populism isn't necessarily a bad thing.) It is tolerant of racism, antisemitism, misogyny and anti-LGBTQ+ sentiments in its midst, either because they are embraced, seen as less important than maintaining movement cohesion, or because the allegations are seen themselves as an invention of corrupt media. They see their opposition as unCanadian and undeserving of rights, and that often extends to equity-deserving groups. They want to take power (in an election or not) and use that power to persecute their enemies. They are against democratic norms like the institution of journalism and the peaceful transition of power. Many of them discuss putting their enemies on trial for treason and hardline elements say they want to “genocide” them. So the far-right isn't regular small-c conservatism, unless you think regular conservatism is tolerant of racism and wants to do away with democracy. I think it's the responsibility of regular conservatives to make sure those lines don't blur and to protect their position from extremists. The far-right movement is a threat to democracy and elements within it inspire the vast majority of modern-day Ideologically Motivated Violent Extremism (IMVE), including mass murders. (What's attributed or blamed on the 'far-left' doesn't even come close. Go take a look at CSIS statements, or the FBIs). The ideologies of the far-right movement and the racist, anti-women, and anti-LGBTQ+ beliefs inside it are often based on simplistic, conspiratorial interpretations of the world that replicate by the spread of disinformation and misinformation. We have always been very clear that not every convoy supporter or antivaxxer is a racist or a white supremacist. I have empathy for people who have lost their jobs or relationships because they started to believe in conspiracies. People have real and valid grievances that our politics are failing to address, especially those stemming from income inequality. The empty promises of the far-right are, understandably, appealing - and can attract otherwise intelligent people.
