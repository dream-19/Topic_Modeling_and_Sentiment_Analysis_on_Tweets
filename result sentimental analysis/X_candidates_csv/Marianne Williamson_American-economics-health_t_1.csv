Evidence is clearly otherwise. The 2017 tax cut - where 83 cents of every dollar went into the hands of the wealthiest Individuals and corporations - will never pay for itself. Giving tax cuts to companies already making billions in profit did not make them invest; the money mainly went to stock buybacks etc. When corporatists talk about reducing the deficit, they are only willing to do so on the backs of the middle class and poor. They are never willing to spend money on catching wealthy tax cheats, repealing unfair tax cuts to the very wealthy, or increasing investment in things that actually support the average person in creating more wealth. The problem is not one individual policy here or there. The problem is big picture: a state of aristocracy and corporate entitlement now baked into the cake in America - the very opposite of a free democratic society in which everyone is supposed to have a fair shot.

As our nation has grown in size and stature, however, these political rights proved inadequate to assure us equality in the pursuit of happiness. We have accepted, so to speak, a second Bill of Rights under which a new basis of security and prosperity can be established for all, regardless of station, race, or creed. Among these are: 1) The right to a useful and remunerative job, 2) The right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation, 3) The right of every farmer to raise and sell his products at a return which will give him and his family a decent living, 4) The right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopolies at home or abroad, 5) The right of every family to a decent home, 6) The right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health, 7) The right to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment, 8) The right to a good education. All of these rights spell security. And after this war is won, we must be prepared to move forward in the implementation of these rights to new goals of human happiness and well-being. For unless there is security here at home, there cannot be lasting peace in the world.‚Äù",january president franklin  roosevelt proposed second bill right secure economic right american people view
