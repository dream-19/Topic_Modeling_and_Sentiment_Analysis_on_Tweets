BillMelugin_,2023-07-27 14:57:33+00:00,"The situation at the border has gotten worse during Mayorkas’ time in office by almost every single metric.

- Back to back years of highest recorded illegal crossings in history.
- 1.5 million + known gotaways.
- Highest number of unaccompanied minors in recorded history via rampant human smuggling. 
- Back to back years of highest terror watchlist encounters in history. 
- Record fentanyl OD deaths & smuggling.
- Cartels enriched & in control of parts of the border. 

While it is true illegal crossings have dropped to much lower levels since the end of Title 42 in May, it is largely because the Biden admin has been admitting tens of thousands of migrants into the US each month through “lawful pathways” via executive parole authority, even though they may have no legal basis to be here, by using CBP One app appointments at ports of entry, and flying them directly into the US if they have a sponsor.
