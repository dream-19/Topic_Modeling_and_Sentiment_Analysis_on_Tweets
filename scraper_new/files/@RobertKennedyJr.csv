JackCarrUSA,2023-08-11 15:33:03+00:00,"It‚Äôs been almost two years.
‚Ä¢
For those interested, my thoughts on, not just the withdrawal from Afghanistan but the close to twenty years that preceded it and what amounts to almost zero accountability for senior level military officers, elected representatives, and appointed bureaucrats who failed upward during that time are captured in a blog I wrote on 16 August 2021 titled ‚ÄúImperial Hubris: The Great Game Revisited‚Äù and an article I wrote for TownHall on 23 August 2021 titled ‚ÄúA Time For Bold Adjustment: Fire The Generals.‚Äù Both can be found on the blog section of my website.
‚Ä¢
From the blog:

I describe the American experience in Afghanistan as ‚Äú‚Ä¶a failure that crossed party lines over four separate administrations, two Republican and two Democrat.  As we watch the U.S. Embassy evacuation in Kabul and see images of the Taliban taking control of the country, to those of us who fought there it is more than a strategic failure; it‚Äôs personal.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis year, for the first time in U.S. history, one could have joined the military, served for twenty years, and retired while the country is still involved in the same war.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn what is accurately described as imperial hubris, the United States political-military establishment confused entry and initial resolve with victory.  They were wrong; America‚Äôs sons and daughters paid the price.‚Äù

‚ÄúSimply put, our elected officials and senior level military leaders were trapped by their own intellectual inertia, condemning us to eventual defeat.‚Äù

‚ÄúStrategically, our leaders were not held to account for their blunders ‚Äî in too many cases, blunders of epic proportions.  Rather, they were promoted and eventually retired with full pensions to sit on the boards of companies making a killing in the world of government contracts; the military industrial complex is alive and well.

Fairmont housekeepers clean 14 to 15 large rooms a day. The hotel, which cut staff during COVID, is now enjoying pre-COVID occupancy rates and profits but nevertheless wants to increase daily workloads to 18 rooms to compensate for understaffing.

3 out of every 5 workers is injured on the job each year due to repetitive lifting of heavy mattresses + bending to scrub and clean.

Workers typically commute 2 hours from Palmdale or Victorville because of the unaffordable housing in Santa Monica. Some live in their cars during the work week to save gas money.

by Naomi Shihab Nye

Before you know what kindness really is
you must lose things,
feel the future dissolve in a moment
like salt in a weakened broth.
What you held in your hand,
what you counted and carefully saved,
all this must go so you know
how desolate the landscape can be
between the regions of kindness.
How you ride and ride
thinking the bus will never stop,
the passengers eating maize and chicken
will stare out the window forever.

Before you learn the tender gravity of kindness
you must travel where the Indian in a white poncho
lies dead by the side of the road.
You must see how this could be you,
how he too was someone
who journeyed through the night with plans
and the simple breath that kept him alive.

Before you know kindness as the deepest thing inside,
you must know sorrow as the other deepest thing.
You must wake up with sorrow.
You must speak to it till your voice
catches the thread of all sorrows
and you see the size of the cloth.
Then it is only kindness that makes sense anymore,
only kindness that ties your shoes
and sends you out into the day to gaze at bread,
only kindness that raises its head
from the crowd of the world to say
It is I you have been looking for,
and then goes with you everywhere
like a shadow or a friend.
