RobertKennedyJr,2023-09-13 22:57:28+00:00,"DNC clarification from my campaign manager @Dennis_Kucinich:

“While we were relieved to learn that it appears the voters of Georgia will have their votes counted, it doesn’t change the underlying truth. Three days after President Biden announced his re-election, the supposedly impartial DNC chair endorsed Mr. Biden and began expenditures on behalf of the Biden campaign. The DNC has refused to sponsor debates, relying on a made-up precedent that ignores the fact that there has not been a significant primary challenge to an incumbent in more than 40 years. The DNC has also proceeded to disenfranchise the voters of New Hampshire and Iowa. It is irrefutable that the DNC IS the Biden campaign and the Biden campaign IS the DNC. All rule interpretations must be seen through that lens. The Biden campaign is setting the rules and can move the goalposts at will. We are simply stating the obvious and its implications for the primaries. We move forward, having proved our point.”"
RobertKennedyJr,2023-09-13 22:58:27+00:00,"Our understanding that Georgia’s voters would not be counted came from a Georgia state party document upon which we relied.

JackCarrUSA,2023-08-11 15:33:03+00:00,"It’s been almost two years.
•
For those interested, my thoughts on, not just the withdrawal from Afghanistan but the close to twenty years that preceded it and what amounts to almost zero accountability for senior level military officers, elected representatives, and appointed bureaucrats who failed upward during that time are captured in a blog I wrote on 16 August 2021 titled “Imperial Hubris: The Great Game Revisited” and an article I wrote for TownHall on 23 August 2021 titled “A Time For Bold Adjustment: Fire The Generals.” Both can be found on the blog section of my website.
•
From the blog:

I describe the American experience in Afghanistan as “…a failure that crossed party lines over four separate administrations, two Republican and two Democrat.  As we watch the U.S. Embassy evacuation in Kabul and see images of the Taliban taking control of the country, to those of us who fought there it is more than a strategic failure; it’s personal.”

“This year, for the first time in U.S. history, one could have joined the military, served for twenty years, and retired while the country is still involved in the same war.”

“In what is accurately described as imperial hubris, the United States political-military establishment confused entry and initial resolve with victory.  They were wrong; America’s sons and daughters paid the price.”

“Simply put, our elected officials and senior level military leaders were trapped by their own intellectual inertia, condemning us to eventual defeat.”

“Strategically, our leaders were not held to account for their blunders — in too many cases, blunders of epic proportions.  Rather, they were promoted and eventually retired with full pensions to sit on the boards of companies making a killing in the world of government contracts; the military industrial complex is alive and well.  As Lt. Col. Paul Yingling pointed out in his 2007 article A Failure in Generalship, ‘As matters stand now, a private who loses a rifle suffers far greater consequences than a general who loses a war.’”

The assassination reduced the President of the United States to a transient official, a servant of the warfare conglomerate.

RobertKennedyJr,2023-07-23 21:51:10+00:00,"Kindness

by Naomi Shihab Nye

Before you know what kindness really is
you must lose things,
feel the future dissolve in a moment
like salt in a weakened broth.
What you held in your hand,
what you counted and carefully saved,
all this must go so you know
how desolate the landscape can be
between the regions of kindness.
How you ride and ride
thinking the bus will never stop,
the passengers eating maize and chicken
will stare out the window forever.

Before you learn the tender gravity of kindness
you must travel where the Indian in a white poncho
lies dead by the side of the road.
You must see how this could be you,
how he too was someone
who journeyed through the night with plans
and the simple breath that kept him alive.

Before you know kindness as the deepest thing inside,
you must know sorrow as the other deepest thing.
You must wake up with sorrow.
You must speak to it till your voice
catches the thread of all sorrows
and you see the size of the cloth.
Then it is only kindness that makes sense anymore,
only kindness that ties your shoes
and sends you out into the day to gaze at bread,
only kindness that raises its head
from the crowd of the world to say
It is I you have been looking for,
and then goes with you everywhere
like a shadow or a friend.

From Words Under the Words: Naomi Shihab Nye"

I understand the emotional pain that these inaccurate distortions and fabrications have caused to many Jews who recall the blood libels of poison wells and the deliberate spread of disease as the pretext for genocidal programs against their ancestors. My father and my uncles, John F. Kennedy and Senator Edward Kennedy, devoted enormous political energies during their careers to supporting Israel and fighting antisemitism. I intend to spend my political career making those family causes my priority. 

I will fight relentlessly alongside my Jewish brothers and sisters and friends against Jew-hatred and the demonization of Israel. I have just recorded an interview with @RabbiShmuley , whom the same New York Post just this month called, “the most famous Rabbi in America.” I have called upon the Biden Administration not to consummate a second Iran deal that would give that genocidal government a legitimized nuclear program. In the same interview, I called upon the Democratic Party to return to the strong, unconditional support of Israel that was the hallmark of the party under the leadership of my uncle and my father. 

Today I had a great conversation with Rabbi Shmuley on Judaism and anti-Semitism. He had this to say: “Two things bothered me about the reports I had read about what you had said at that dinner on the upper east side. I said number one, again, this perception that you’re anti-Semitic. I know you’re not. And in fact, I know precisely the opposite is true. I know that in your heart you feel a great closeness to the Jewish people, to the Jewish community, and to Israel. And the second thing that bothered me is, that you’re being portrayed as you said before, a crank, as a loony toon…but you’re brilliant. You know your facts.”"

RobertKennedyJr,2023-06-27 04:24:01+00:00,"RT @Dr. Offit, your revised definition of ""placebo"" as ""immunologically inert"" would focus on testing efficacy, not safety, which is precisely the substantive concern raised by @RobertKennedyJr and others when explaining that childhood vaccines are virtually never licensed based on trials that included a control group receiving an inert substance.

In addition, it is categorically false to claim that ""all vaccine trials"" included an ""immunologically inert"" control. This is because most childhood vaccine trials used other vaccines as a control, which, by definition, are immunologically active.

The use of vaccines as controls is highly concerning because the control vaccines were virtually never licensed based on a placebo-controlled trial – meaning ""inert"" per CDC/FDA. This is true even for trials of the first vaccine for a target disease. Hence, the safety of the subject or control vaccine was virtually never properly assessed in any clinical trial.

For example, Prevnar-13 was licensed based on a trial comparing it to Prevnar-7, and Prevnar-7 was licensed based on a trial comparing it to another experimental vaccine. ""Serious adverse events reported following vaccination in infants and toddlers occurred in 8.2% among Prevnar 13 recipients and 7.2% among Prevnar 7 recipients."" Meaning, equally safe by FDA standards. But equally unsafe by any other standard.

As another example, in Gardasil’s trial, 2.3% of the Gardasil group and 2.3% of the control group (which received an injection of a proprietary adjuvant which can cause autoimmune issues) had a suspected autoimmune disorder. Again, meaning equally safe by FDA standards. But equally unsafe by any other standard.

I trust you agree that the safety of products injected repeatedly into babies is very important. Without an inert comparator, harm can be obfuscated. While you label it ""absurd"" to define a placebo as having ""no effect on living beings,"" that is, verbatim, the CDC’s definition of ""placebo"" in its Vaccine Glossary. What is ""absurd"" is to define a ""placebo"" as a vaccine or an adjuvant.

As this is a critically important issue, I gladly welcome a respectful in-person discussion where we each present our evidence regarding clinical trials for childhood vaccines to best understand each other’s position for the common goal of protecting children. Would you agree to have that discussion?

https://t.co/rfENqkRqab"
emeriticus,2023-05-30 21:18:00+00:00,"Nowhere in this article is it noted that Pfizer was the biggest medical donor to Trump’s inauguration, which bought the company four tickets to a “leadership luncheon” with “select Cabinet appointees and House and Senate leadership.” That’s how pharma shills like Scott Gottlieb and Alex Azar ended up in the Trump administration. That’s also why Trump killed the vaccine safety commission Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was supposed to lead. That and the fact Trump cared more about the counsel of people like Bill Gates on vaccines than his own supporters. 

Trump bragged last year about how huge the Johnson & Johnson pharmaceutical fortune is after the company received $1 billion for Operation Warp Speed. He protested when the J&J drug was temporarily pulled off the market when people kept dying in connection to it before it was completely nixed this year. 

Trump’s financial disclosures show he holds stock in J&J and Pfizer. 

The purpose of outlets like The National Pulse is to make you miss the forest for the trees, sinking your attention in peripheral details so you don’t notice the fish rots from the head down. Big Pharma influenced the last administration because Trump took their money and invited them into the White House."

John F. Kennedy: “As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them.”

We must never let our freedoms as Americans die. We cannot truly remember and honor those who fought and died for us and our way of life without remembering and honoring what they died for, lest it be in vain. I believe as Americans we have a duty to ensure that these freedoms remain for generations to come, to support and defend the U.S. Constitution and American founding principles.

I thank and honor the brave Americans who gave their lives for our country. May this Memorial Day remind us of the preciousness of their lives and of human life, so that we may become a nation of peace in the future.

He left Harvard Law School in June 1941 to join the Naval Air Corps as an aviator flying 25 bombing missions from Suffolk field in Britain. Just before his discharge, he volunteered for a top-secret and high-risk mission intended to destroy the Nazi’s North Sea U-Boat pens near Heligoland by striking them with a radio-controlled B-24 bomb plane loaded with high explosives.

Lt Kennedy’s assignment was to pilot the plane to 2,500 feet, arm the detonators and parachute out after switching to remote control and turning the steering over to radio pilots in a pursuit plane. His bomber exploded in midair moments after Joe switched to remote.

A state organized on the principle that it exists to protect the sovereign rights of individuals, is being replaced by a digital leviathan that wields power through opaque algorithms and the manipulation of digital swarms.
