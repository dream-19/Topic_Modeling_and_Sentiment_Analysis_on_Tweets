LauraLoomer,2023-08-14 01:53:26+00:00,"Today was the best day of my life. I got to spend the entire day with the greatest President our country has ever had: DONALD J TRUMP! 

President Donald Trump is the most down to earth and amazing person ever. He is the best host. He is hilarious and he is also very generous and kind. 

I had a regular ticket for the #LivGolf tournament today, and he saw me when he was getting into his golf cart. He got out of his golf cart and told me to come to his box, and he walked over to me to take a picture with me, telling me how thankful he was for all of my work exposing @RonDeSantis DeSanctus. 

I was supposed to fly back to Florida today but I extended my trip after speaking in New York City so I could show up to Bedminster today to show support for President Trump since he‚Äôs under attack by the DOJ nonstop. I had no idea if I would meet him, and just came to support him and film videos of all of his fans so I could show everyone how much his is loved by the people. 

I can‚Äôt believe I ended up sitting next to him the entire day, eating with him and learning about golf. He wanted me to sit next to him all day, and it was the best day ever. He is truly one of a kind and there‚Äôs nothing that I wouldn‚Äôt do for him. 

I am so thankful for @RealDonaldTrump. I really love him with all of my heart. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è And I appreciate him choosing to sit next to me today when there were tons of pro-athletes and major donors at the same event today who he could have easily had sit with him in his box instead. 

Donald Trump inspires me to never give up, he inspires me to be a fighter, and he has inspired me for years, even before he was a candidate for President. Everyone who knows me knows I am President Trump‚Äôs biggest fan and have been since I was a teenager and in college where I was the President of College Republicans. 

I will be fighting as hard as I can to get him elected in 2024. And then once he‚Äôs elected, I will give up my entire life in Florida where I have lived for most of my adult life, and I will to move to DC to work for him and fight for him in the swamp where I will protect him from disloyal people‚Ä¶ if he wants me to! 

I wouldn‚Äôt even think twice about it. 

We all need to fight for Donald Trump! #Trump2024 #MAGA",126.0

The soldiers were armed with machine guns and trucks, but they proved to be ineffective against the fast and agile emus, who scattered and regrouped at will.

The emus also seemed to have a remarkable ability to survive bullets, as some of them were reported to have taken up to five shots before falling. The soldiers managed to kill only about 250 emus out of an estimated 20,000. The war ended after six weeks, with the emus declared the victors.",160.0
