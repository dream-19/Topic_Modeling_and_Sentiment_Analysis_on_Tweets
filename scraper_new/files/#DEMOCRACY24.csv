30,phil_r063019,2023-09-25 17:46:26+00:00,#Pete is the best spokesperson for this administration. A leader that is a hope for the future. #DEMOCRACY24
31,politicsusa46,2023-09-24 23:41:53+00:00,"Some say people are born to be leaders. For me the jury is out on that. I think leaders use their lived experience to learn what it is to be a leader.

Pete Buttigieg is a shining example of how public service helps shape leadership. There’s no better baptism of fire than being a mayor with all the challenges that brings.

The first time I heard him speak, I instinctively knew he was the type of politician that rarely graces the political stage. The more I researched the guy, the more impressed I was. He has served his country in uniform as well as in a suit, not something many if any MAGA Republicans can say.

His audacious run for President in 2020 was a measure of the man. Above all, it highlighted what an adept communicator he was. Take a listen to the clip below to see just how good he is. His ability to think on his feet and stay ad cool as a still pond regardless of the incoming, is truly impressive.

Joe Biden was not slow to notice just what value he could bring to his new government. How right he was. As Secretary of Transport, he has taken on the role intent to stamp his mark. As a skillful advocate for the societal benefits infrastructure, he’s able to articulate the administration’s position, not only on his brief, but on wider political challenges.

He’s a polyglot, who learns languages for fun, a musician and now a dad to twins with his husband Chasten. To be a great leader you have to understand the challenges of real American families and while it would be fair to say he didn’t grow up poor, you get the impression that equality and inclusion are both on his bingo card.

America you are blessed to have him. Be sure not to waste this gift.

94,OccupyDemocrats,2023-09-13 17:24:23+00:00,"BREAKING: Damning MAGA news leaks as it's revealed that deranged Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene dined with Donald Trump at his Bedminster golf course on Sunday and laid out the scheme to impeach President Biden — proving that it's a cheap political stunt.

Greene met with the disgraced, repeatedly indicted ex-president at his New Jersey lair and the two chatted ""over halibut and Diet Cokes.""

When contacted by The New York Times, Greene confirmed the meeting. During it, she laid out her impeachment strategy, vindictively telling Trump that she wants the impeachment inquiry to be ""long and excruciatingly painful for Joe Biden.""

In other words, this new impeachment inquiry is revenge for impeaching Donald Trump (twice). The crucial difference is that Trump committed countless crimes and Joe Biden is just being vaguely accused of ""corruption,"" meaning Republicans want to smear him but can't find anything real.

The fact that Trump is puppeteering this joke of an impeachment tells you all you really need to know about it. It'ss engineered to help his failing 2024 campaign and should be treated as such.

Please retweet and ❤️ if you stand with Joe Biden — and consider joining the growing exodus to Tribel, a “woke” new Twitter competitor that banned Trump for life and is exploding in popularity because Elon Musk banned Tribel’s Twitter account — but he forgot to ban this link to download the new Tribe app: https://t.co/HnJzSKjCwX"

📉No confidence in his ability to serve: 74%, including a majority of Democrats, do not think @JoeBiden has the stamina and sharpness to serve effectively as president.

📉Electability problem: 67% of Democrats wish the party would nominate someone other than Biden, and Biden loses to nearly every Republican tested in a 2024 general election matchup.

📉Failing and flailing on policy: 58% say Biden's policies have made economic conditions in the U.S. worse. 70% say things in the country are going badly. And just 39% approve of the job Biden is doing overall.

📉Biden's personal image is cratering: A majority say Biden does not care about people like themselves and 72% say he does not inspire confidence.

📉No one is buying Biden's lies: 61% say Biden did have some involvement in his son Hunter Biden's business dealings in Ukraine and China WHILE serving as Vice President.

We had lawyers writing papers on how to keep Trump in office, slates of fake electors in several states, people breaking into voting machines, congressman refusing to certify, thousands of phone calls, emails, texts and DMs pressuring officials to declare Trump the winner. Audits, investigations, fake lawsuits.  Election officials threatened, voting machine companies vilified. Lies on the news every day and criminal actions at every level of government.  It was a tidal wave of dishonesty and law breaking, a criminal enterprise with Donald Trump at the head.

Then there was January 6th.  People crawling up the walls, smashing windows, bashing in doors and beating policeman.  Five deaths.  All in the people's house. 

We're left picking up the pieces surrounded by politicians still pounding the drum of a stolen election.  It's just staggering to me the scale of what happened, and it's amazing a system designed hundreds of years ago held.  

Now there is accountability.  There should be many more states pursuing indictments including my own, Arizona.  No matter how long it takes.  We need to hold everyone who played a part accountable."

And it gets even better! These students are charged up to fight back against the Jordan's attempts to... 
– take away voting rights
– control women
– and put God and Guns over EVERYTHING else in America.

The Gen Z youth I talked to say TONS of their friends are joining the fight. And they say it with a smile. Their excitement is contagious! 😊

Look, I'll be real with you: Some days on the campaign trail are hard. Running against Jim Jordan means running into a few unpleasant people who see me as a real threat to his power (they ain't wrong).

But this wasn’t one of those days.

⚡ I'm charged up, but I need your help to double down: 
 
Because I'm hell bent on CRUSHING horrible candidates trying to destroy our future I want to register 10 TIMES more Gen Z voters – and replicate this crowd in EVERY critical district in Ohio.

Will you help them do it? 💪

661,EdKrassen,2023-08-22 15:28:32+00:00,"This morning many people are spreading a video of Joe Biden, calling him ""Sleepy Joe"" because it appears as though he might be sleeping while visiting wildfire survivors in Lahaina in Maui County, Hawaii.

This is FALSE.

When you actually watch a longer clip, you can see that he obviously wasn't sleeping.

In fact, he had his head down as the speaker was talking about the massive amount of people who had lost homes, family members, and lives. Multiple people sitting around him were wiping tears from their eyes as he bowed his head for a brief few seconds. 

Yes. Joe Biden is old.  No, he isn't the greatest speaker in the world -- far from it.  But what's the purpose of trying to mislead people into believing he fell asleep, when it is obvious that that was not the case?"

That's something I never thought I would hear.

CNN Senior Legal Analyst Elie Honig blasted the DOJ for their 'inexplicable' conduct with Hunter Biden.

""I genuinely am perplexed by what DOJ’s doing here.""

""It’s really inexplicable to me. First, we had basically five years of behind-the-scenes investigation with no transparency, no action, and some questions being asked, what’s taken so long?""

""And then they go all the way to appointing a special counsel, the same guy who’s been presiding over the case for five-plus years already.""

""I think they’ve made a real mess for themselves and now they’re going to have to deal with the consequences of it.""

Too little, too late!"
