The whole narrative has been '#Biden is too old.' People are being asked in polls, 'Do you find Biden old?' During his presidency, Trump was bragging about passing a cognitive test: man, woman, person, camera, television. This is wild stuff. Biden just got back from a five-day trip [to India's G-20 and Vietnam.] The guy has been doing a great job. Every time he speaks, he's fine.

The writers have important issues that I sympathize with, and hope they are addressed to their satisfaction, but they are not the only people with issues, problems, and concerns. Despite some assistance from me, much of the staff is struggling mightily. We all were hopeful this would come to an end after Labor Day, but that day has come and gone, and there still seems to be nothing happening. I love my writers, I am one of them, but I‚Äôm not prepared to lose an entire year and see so many below-the-line people suffer so much. I will honor the spirit of the strike by not doing a monologue, desk piece, New Rules or editorial, the written pieces that I am so proud of on Real Time. And I‚Äôll say it upfront to the audience: the show I will be doing without my writers will not be as good as our normal show, full stop.

These views and tactics are expressly contrary to sacred Jewish and biblical teaching.

When justly criticized, ADL and its defenders falsely claim anti-Semitism, thereby diminishing all past and present victims of anti-Semitism.

In fact, conflating criticism of ADL with criticism of Jews is itself an anti-Semitic trope.

Bottom line: ADL is a disreputable organization that has gravely undermined Jewish interests and is worthy of the strongest condemnation."
