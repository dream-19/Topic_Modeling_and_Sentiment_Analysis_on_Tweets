464,WillHurd,2023-07-19 00:15:39+00:00,"Joe Biden's inability to control the border has caused this humanitarian crisis. This has gone on for too long under Biden and Trump. 

America needs a border reset with the following actions:"
465,WillHurd,2023-07-19 00:15:40+00:00,"3. Pressure the President of Mexico for cooperation and meaningful action to work together to dismantle the cartels and human smugglers. 

4. Achieve operational control of the border with technology that already exists and more manpower."
466,WillHurd,2023-07-19 00:15:40+00:00,"5. Enlist other countries to establish welcome centers and handle the deportation of their citizens more efficiently. 

By taking these steps, we can secure the border, treat migrants humanely, and put an end to this humanitarian crisis."
