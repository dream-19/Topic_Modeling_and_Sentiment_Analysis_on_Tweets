In 2018, Joe Biden publicly boasted about his central role in having Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin fired.

By his own admission, Joe Biden said he made the removal of Prosecutor General Shokin –  the man leading the investigation into Burisma, Hunter’s cash cow – a condition for Ukraine to receive a critical $1 billion loan guarantee.

@RepJamesComer is requesting Secretary of State Antony Blinken to provide information on then-Vice President Biden’s sudden shift on Ukraine policy that just so happens to coincide with Hunter’s business interests.

Joe Biden’s VP staff colluded with Hunter’s business partner on Burisma corruption media response.

@RepJamesComer is calling on the National Archives to provide complete and unredacted documents related to the Office of the Vice President colluding with the Biden family and their business associates.

In one example, on December 4, 2015, Eric Schwerin, a longtime Biden family business associate, wrote to Kate Bedingfield in the Office of the Vice President, providing quotes the White House should use in response to media outreach regarding Hunter Biden’s role in Burisma.

Later that day, Ms. Bedingfield responded to Mr. Schwerin saying, “VP signed off on this[.]”

According to Devon Archer, after a Burisma board of directors meeting in Dubai on the evening of December 4, 2015, Hunter Biden “called D.C.” to discuss pressure that Burisma asked him to relieve.

In the letter to the U.S. Archivist, Chairman Comer is requesting the documents and information below regarding communications between the Office of the Vice President and Hunter Biden or his business associates.

GOPoversight,2023-09-06 16:04:46+00:00,"🚨 BREAKING 🚨

Joe Biden’s VP staff colluded with Hunter’s business partner on Burisma corruption media response.

@RepJamesComer is calling on the National Archives to provide complete and unredacted documents related to the Office of the Vice President colluding with the Biden family and their business associates.

In one example, on December 4, 2015, Eric Schwerin, a longtime Biden family business associate, wrote to Kate Bedingfield in the Office of the Vice President, providing quotes the White House should use in response to media outreach regarding Hunter Biden’s role in Burisma.

Later that day, Ms. Bedingfield responded to Mr. Schwerin saying, “VP signed off on this[.]”

During U.S. Attorney Weiss’ investigation, the Biden transition team was TIPPED OFF about the planned Hunter Biden interview. The IRS & FBI team were told to stand down and WAIT FOR HUNTER TO CALL before they could interview him. That call that never came, and they never interviewed Hunter Biden.

The DOJ is attempting a Biden family coverup.

Moments ago, AG Garland announced he is designating U.S. Attorney for Delaware David Weiss as special counsel for the Biden criminal investigation. This is part of the DOJ’s efforts to attempt a Biden family coverup in light of our Committee’s mounting evidence of President Joe Biden’s role in his family’s schemes selling “the brand” for millions of dollars to foreign nationals.

The Justice Department’s misconduct and politicization in the Biden criminal investigation already allowed the statute of limitations to run with respect to egregious felonies committed by Hunter Biden. Justice Department officials refused to follow evidence that could have led to Joe Biden, tipped off the Biden transition team and Hunter Biden’s lawyers about planned interviews and searches, and attempted to sneakily place Hunter Biden on the path to a sweetheart plea deal.

Let’s be clear what today’s move is really about. The Biden Justice Department is trying to stonewall congressional oversight as we have presented evidence to the American people about the Biden family’s corruption. Our Committee will continue to follow the Biden family’s money trail and interview witnesses to determine whether foreign actors targeted the Bidens, President Biden is compromised and corrupt, and our national security is threatened. We will also continue to work with the House Committees on @JudiciaryGOP and @WaysAndMeansGOP to root out misconduct at the Justice Department and hold bad actors accountable for weaponizing law enforcement powers.
