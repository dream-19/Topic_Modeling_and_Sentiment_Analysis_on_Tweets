𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐁𝐢𝐝𝐞𝐧 𝐟𝐚𝐦𝐢𝐥𝐲 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐢𝐫 𝐛𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐚𝐬𝐬𝐨𝐜𝐢𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐬 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐞𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐝 𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫 $𝟐𝟒 𝐦𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐞𝐢𝐠𝐧 𝐬𝐨𝐮𝐫𝐜𝐞𝐬 𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐜𝐨𝐮𝐫𝐬𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐱𝐢𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐥𝐲 𝐟𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐲𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐬.

-From 2014 to 2019, Biden family members and their affiliate companies received over $15 million from foreign companies and foreign nationals in Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan, Romania, and China. Biden business associates received an additional $9 million.

-This money was transmitted to Biden family members from foreign sources through an exceedingly complex chain of transactions that made it difficult to track the flow of these funds.

𝐏𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐁𝐢𝐝𝐞𝐧 𝐰𝐚𝐬 𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐲 𝐢𝐧𝐯𝐨𝐥𝐯𝐞𝐝 𝐢𝐧 𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐟𝐚𝐦𝐢𝐥𝐲’𝐬 𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐞𝐢𝐠𝐧 𝐛𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐝𝐞𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐬𝐞 𝐛𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐚𝐫𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐨𝐟𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐝𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐞𝐬.

-The President had knowledge of many of his family’s business dealings, and indeed participated in them by having phone calls and attending private dinners—including while he was Vice President—with his family’s business associates and foreign business associates who would pay his family millions of dollars for no identifiable product or service.

-These foreign business associates of the President’s family had interests in countries where then-Vice President Biden—and as President—played, and continues to play, an active role in formulating and implementing the foreign policy of the United States.

-Weeks before the 2020 Presidential election, then-candidate Joe Biden said on national television that his family did not receive any money from China. That was a lie. Joe Biden not only knew about his family’s work with Chinese nationals, business associates have confirmed that Joe Biden met with his family’s Chinese associates—including while he was Vice President.

-President Biden’s assertions that he never discussed business with his family are false."

On July 26, 2023, Hunter Biden appeared before the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware for a hearing on the unprecedented plea deal involving Hunter Biden agreed to by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Delaware. 

However, the plea deal fell apart when prosecutors and defense attorneys could not provide answers to routine questions about the agreement posed by Judge Noreika.  
 
A little over three weeks later, on August 19, 2023, the @nytimes and @politico published separate articles providing detailed accounts of the failed settlement negotiations between the Department and Hunter Biden’s lawyers based on nonpublic information, including previously undisclosed documents and communications.

There are a limited number of people who would have had access to the documents and communications discussed in these articles, and based on the narrative set forth in these pieces, the Committees believe it is highly likely that these materials were provided to these media outlets by or at the direction of the Biden legal defense team.

Given that these disclosures have been made to two media outlets and this information has been widely publicized, no basis exists to withhold these documents and communications from the Committees, including on the basis of any purported duty of confidentiality, work product, or other privilege interest.

On July 26, 2023, Hunter Biden appeared before the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware for a hearing on the unprecedented plea deal involving Hunter Biden agreed to by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Delaware. 

However, the plea deal fell apart when prosecutors and defense attorneys could not provide answers to routine questions about the agreement posed by Judge Noreika.  
 
A little over three weeks later, on August 19, 2023, the @nytimes and @politico published separate articles providing detailed accounts of the failed settlement negotiations between the Department and Hunter Biden’s lawyers based on nonpublic information, including previously undisclosed documents and communications. 

𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐢𝐧𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐝 𝐢𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐬𝐞 𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐫𝐞𝐢𝐧𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐜𝐞𝐬 𝐬𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐨𝐮𝐬 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐬 𝐫𝐞𝐠𝐚𝐫𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐰𝐡𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐃𝐞𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐡𝐚𝐬 𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐥𝐞𝐝 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐜𝐚𝐬𝐞 𝐢𝐧𝐯𝐨𝐥𝐯𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐏𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐁𝐢𝐝𝐞𝐧’𝐬 𝐬𝐨𝐧 𝐢𝐧 𝐚𝐧 𝐢𝐦𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐧𝐞𝐫 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐢𝐬 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐨𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐬𝐞𝐜𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬.

There are a limited number of people who would have had access to the documents and communications discussed in these articles, and based on the narrative set forth in these pieces, the Committees believe it is highly likely that these materials were provided to these media outlets by or at the direction of the Biden legal defense team.

Given that these disclosures have been made to two media outlets and this information has been widely publicized, no basis exists to withhold these documents and communications from the Committees, including on the basis of any purported duty of confidentiality, work product, or other privilege interest. 

Should Hunter Biden’s attorneys refuse to provide the Committees with the requested information because of any purported privilege, 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐢𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐞𝐬 𝐦𝐚𝐲 𝐧𝐞𝐞𝐝 𝐭𝐨 𝐬𝐞𝐞𝐤 𝐭𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐨𝐧𝐲 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐦 𝐚𝐧𝐝/𝐨𝐫 𝐇𝐮𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐁𝐢𝐝𝐞𝐧 𝐫𝐞𝐠𝐚𝐫𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐝𝐢𝐬𝐜𝐥𝐨𝐬𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐬𝐞 𝐝𝐨𝐜𝐮𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 𝐭𝐨 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐍𝐞𝐰 𝐘𝐨𝐫𝐤 𝐓𝐢𝐦𝐞𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐏𝐨𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐨."

Joe Biden’s VP staff colluded with Hunter’s business partner on Burisma corruption media response.

@RepJamesComer is calling on the National Archives to provide complete and unredacted documents related to the Office of the Vice President colluding with the Biden family and their business associates.

In one example, on December 4, 2015, Eric Schwerin, a longtime Biden family business associate, wrote to Kate Bedingfield in the Office of the Vice President, providing quotes the White House should use in response to media outreach regarding Hunter Biden’s role in Burisma.

Later that day, Ms. Bedingfield responded to Mr. Schwerin saying, “VP signed off on this[.]”

According to Devon Archer, after a Burisma board of directors meeting in Dubai on the evening of December 4, 2015, Hunter Biden “called D.C.” to discuss pressure that Burisma asked him to relieve.

In the letter to the U.S. Archivist, Chairman Comer is requesting the documents and information below regarding communications between the Office of the Vice President and Hunter Biden or his business associates.

◾️ Complete and unredacted versions of all documents from Records on Hunter Biden, James Biden, and their Foreign Business Dealings, Case Number 2022-0121-F;
