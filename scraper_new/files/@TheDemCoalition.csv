Biden, donning a @UAW International Union baseball cap, used a bullhorn to address members striking outside General Motors' Willow Run Redistribution Center in Belleville, Michigan.

""The fact of the matter is that you guys, UAW, you saved the automobile industry back in 2008 and before,"" Biden said. ""Made a lot of sacrifices, gave up a lot and the companies were in trouble. But now they're doing incredibly well and guess what, you should be doing incredibly well too. Folks, stick with it because you deserve the significant raise you need and other benefits,"" he continued.

The ratio of CEO pay to worker pay is spiraling out of control. In 1970, the average CEO compensation was 11 times the average hourly worker wages. In 1980, it was 42 to 1. In 1990 it was 85 to 1. Today it is estimated to be 399 to 1, on average.

The horrible new ABC News/Washington Post poll finds Donald ahead by 9 points against President Biden.

The MEDIA is to blame for this.

In 2016, watching broadcast and cable news normalize Donald, a corrupt and incompetent man, was very difficult for me to endure. 

They presented him as if he were a legitimate candidate, despite the many failures and crimes he’d left in his path for over 60 years. 

They had no problem airing his rallies in full; they ignored credible allegations of business fraud and sexual assault—as well as actual evidence of his multiple bankruptcies, horrific treatment of treatment of workers, and gob-smacking failure as a “deal-maker.”

And you know what’s horrifying? 

They are doing it again. And this time, it’s worse. 

As cable news organizations struggle for ratings, they spend more time talking about Biden’s age than Donald’s 4 indictments, 91 criminal charges, and disastrous first terms. Plus, Biden is only THREE years older than Donald!!! In 2016, Donald was the oldest president in history to be elected and no one talked about his age. 

That’s because this narrative is complete bullshit. 

It is not normal for someone with 91 criminal charges across four jurisdictions to be a party’s front runner for president. 

It’s not normal for the media to talk about a man who’s accused of launching a coup against our country as a legitimate candidate. 

It’s not normal for the media to talk about a man who was found legally responsible for rape as a legitimate candidate. 

None of this is normal. 

I know this poll is an outlier, but in a sane country Biden would be ahead by 40 points. In a healthy, functioning democracy, Donald would not even be allowed to run.

I’m fighting back in part by cataloguing in my newsletter not just his crimes but the crimes and complicity of his enablers. We know the corporate media won’t do it on their own. 👇🧵 

Help me get the word out before the media’s kid glove treatment gets Donald back into the White House.

Here are the details. Please share them with everyone you know!

The #MAGATaxScam is the most recent attempt by Republicans to push their FAILED trickle-down philosophy on all of us to benefit their wealthy donors.

Their plan would:

▪️ Give $5.1 trillion in tax cuts skewed to the wealthy and big corporations. (The top 0.1 percent - households making more than $4 million per year - would get tax cuts averaging at least $175,000 per year.)

▪️ Eliminate the requirement that the most profitable companies pay the corporate minimum tax the President signed into law.

▪️ Make trillions of dollars of cuts to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs seniors and working families count on to pay for their 1% tax cuts. 

▪️ Increase the Social Security retirement age to 69. 

▪️ Restrict eligibility for Social Security Disability Insurance, slash disability benefits, and raise Medicare premiums for many seniors.

▪️ Cut Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act, and the Children’s Health Insurance Program by more than 50%, which could result in tens of millions of people losing their health insurance, while repealing protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions.

▪️ Raise prescription drug costs by eliminating Medicare’s ability to negotiate prices, eliminating the $35 per month cap on insulin costs for Medicare beneficiaries, and eliminating the requirement that drug companies pay rebates to Medicare when they raise prices faster than inflation.

▪️ Slash Pell Grants by at least $1,000 for millions of students while eliminating eligibility for hundreds of thousands of students from moderate-income families.

Who do Republicans work for? It sure as hell ain't us.

▪️ Cut Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act, and the Children’s Health Insurance Program by more than 50%, which could result in tens of millions of people losing their health insurance, while repealing protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions.

▪️ Raise prescription drug costs by eliminating Medicare’s ability to negotiate prices, eliminating the $35 per month cap on insulin costs for Medicare beneficiaries, and eliminating the requirement that drug companies pay rebates to Medicare when they raise prices faster than inflation.

▪️ Slash Pell Grants by at least $1,000 for millions of students while eliminating eligibility for hundreds of thousands of students from moderate-income families."

Despite Republicans crisscrossing the country claiming credit for Bidenomics projects they voted to block, they have remained conspicuously quiet about their #MAGAnomics Budget — and it’s no mystery why >>> 

Core pillars of the #MAGATaxScam plan:

• Slash Taxes for the Wealthy and Big Corporations. The MAGAnomics Budget calls for $5.1 trillion in tax cuts skewed to the wealthy and big corporations. Under their plan, the top 1% —households making more than $4 million per year—would get tax cuts averaging at
least $175,000 per year.  That’s more than 2 times a typical American family’s entire annual income. On top of that, the most profitable corporations would no longer have to pay the minimum tax the President signed into law.

• Cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and Other Vital Programs. How do House Republicans square their lavish tax giveaways for the wealthy with their stated commitment to reducing the deficit? By making trillions of dollars of cuts to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs seniors and working families count on. The MAGAnomics Budget would increase the Social Security retirement age to 69, restrict eligibility for Social Security Disability Insurance and slash disability benefits, and raise Medicare premiums for many seniors. 

Republicans want to further cut Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act, and the Children’s Health Insurance Program more than in half, which could result in tens of millions of people losing their health insurance, while repealing protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions.

• Raise Costs for Hardworking Families. The MAGAnomics Budget does the bidding of Big Pharma by raising prescription drug costs by eliminating Medicare’s ability to negotiate prices, eliminating the $35 per month cap on insulin costs for Medicare beneficiaries, and eliminating the requirement that drug companies pay rebates to Medicare when they raise prices faster than inflation. It repeals the Inflation Reduction Act’s expansion of premium tax credits, driving up health insurance premiums by an average of $800 for nearly 15 million people. It raises taxes by thousands of dollars on middle class families who purchase electric vehicles or install heat pumps. It slashes Pell Grants by at least $1,000 for millions of students while eliminating eligibility for hundreds of thousands of students from moderate-income families. The list goes on and on.

#Bidenomics, which has already fueled record investment in manufacturing and jobs includes proposals to make the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share while cutting taxes for working families; protect and strengthen Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid; and reduce the deficit by an additional $2.5 trillion over 10 years.

Fiscally irresponsible Republicans continue their deficit-expanding attacks on the middle class and are quietly advancing a package of massive tax cuts for big corporations—including proposals that would funnel large giveaways to private equity firms and pushing legislation to ensure U.S. multinational companies can continue cutting their tax rates by shifting jobs overseas and sheltering income in tax havens around the world.

Here are the details. Please share them with everyone you know!

The #MAGATaxScam is the most recent attempt by Republicans to push their FAILED trickle-down philosophy on all of us to benefit their wealthy donors.

Their plan would:

▪️ Give $5.1 trillion in tax cuts skewed to the wealthy and big corporations. (The top 0.1 percent - households making more than $4 million per year - would get tax cuts averaging at least $175,000 per year.)

▪️ Eliminate the requirement that the most profitable companies pay the corporate minimum tax the President signed into law.

▪️ Make trillions of dollars of cuts to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs seniors and working families count on to pay for their 1% tax cuts. 

▪️ Increase the Social Security retirement age to 69. 

▪️ Restrict eligibility for Social Security Disability Insurance, slash disability benefits, and raise Medicare premiums for many seniors.

▪️ Cut Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act, and the Children’s Health Insurance Program by more than 50%, which could result in tens of millions of people losing their health insurance, while repealing protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions.

▪️ Raise prescription drug costs by eliminating Medicare’s ability to negotiate prices, eliminating the $35 per month cap on insulin costs for Medicare beneficiaries, and eliminating the requirement that drug companies pay rebates to Medicare when they raise prices faster than inflation.

▪️ Slash Pell Grants by at least $1,000 for millions of students while eliminating eligibility for hundreds of thousands of students from moderate-income families.

Who do Republicans work for? It sure as hell ain't us."

1664,TheDemCoalition,2023-09-05 00:26:56+00:00,"RT @A British writer penned the best description of Donald Trump I’ve ever read:

“Why do some British people not like Donald Trump?” 

A few things spring to mind. Trump lacks certain qualities which the British traditionally esteem. For instance, he has no class, no charm, no coolness, no credibility, no compassion, no wit, no warmth, no wisdom, no subtlety, no sensitivity, no self-awareness, no humility, no honour and no grace – all qualities, funnily enough, with which his predecessor Mr. Obama was generously blessed. So for us, the stark contrast does rather throw Trump’s limitations into embarrassingly sharp relief. 

Plus, we like a laugh. And while Trump may be laughable, he has never once said anything wry, witty or even faintly amusing – not once, ever. I don’t say that rhetorically, I mean it quite literally: not once, not ever. And that fact is particularly disturbing to the British sensibility – for us, to lack humour is almost inhuman. But with Trump, it’s a fact. He doesn’t even seem to understand what a joke is – his idea of a joke is a crass comment, an illiterate insult, a casual act of cruelty. 

Trump is a troll. And like all trolls, he is never funny and he never laughs; he only crows or jeers. And scarily, he doesn’t just talk in crude, witless insults – he actually thinks in them. His mind is a simple bot-like algorithm of petty prejudices and knee-jerk nastiness. 

There is never any under-layer of irony, complexity, nuance or depth. It’s all surface. Some Americans might see this as refreshingly upfront. Well, we don’t. We see it as having no inner world, no soul. And in Britain we traditionally side with David, not Goliath. All our heroes are plucky underdogs: Robin Hood, Dick Whittington, Oliver Twist. Trump is neither plucky, nor an underdog. He is the exact opposite of that. He’s not even a spoiled rich-boy, or a greedy fat-cat. He’s more a fat white slug. A Jabba the Hutt of privilege.

And worse, he is that most unforgivable of all things to the British: a bully. That is, except when he is among bullies; then he suddenly transforms into a snivelling sidekick instead. There are unspoken rules to this stuff – the Queensberry rules of basic decency – and he breaks them all. He punches downwards – which a gentleman should, would, could never do – and every blow he aims is below the belt. He particularly likes to kick the vulnerable or voiceless – and he kicks them when they are down.

So the fact that a significant minority – perhaps a third – of Americans look at what he does, listen to what he says, and then think ‘Yeah, he seems like my kind of guy’ is a matter of some confusion and no little distress to British people, given that:

• Americans are supposed to be nicer than us, and mostly are.

• You don’t need a particularly keen eye for detail to spot a few flaws in the man. 

This last point is what especially confuses and dismays British people, and many other people too; his faults seem pretty bloody hard to miss. After all, it’s impossible to read a single tweet, or hear him speak a sentence or two, without staring deep into the abyss. He turns being artless into an art form; he is a Picasso of pettiness; a Shakespeare of shit. His faults are fractal: even his flaws have flaws, and so on ad infinitum. God knows there have always been stupid people in the world, and plenty of nasty people too. But rarely has stupidity been so nasty, or nastiness so stupid. He makes Nixon look trustworthy and George W look smart. In fact, if Frankenstein decided to make a monster assembled entirely from human flaws – he would make a Trump.

And a remorseful Doctor Frankenstein would clutch out big clumpfuls of hair and scream in anguish: ‘My God… what… have… I… created?' If being a twat was a TV show, Trump would be the boxed set.”

FACT: Union members make 18% more on average than non-union members and are 60% more likely to have health benefits and almost twice as likely to have retirement benefits. 

Unions provide many benefits to workers, including:

- Collective Bargaining: Unions can negotiate with employers on behalf of their members to secure better wages, benefits, and working conditions. By joining together, workers have a greater bargaining power than they would individually.

- Improved Job Security: Unions can help protect workers from layoffs or unjust termination by negotiating job security provisions in collective bargaining agreements.

- Improved Compensation: Unions can negotiate for higher wages, overtime pay, and benefits like health insurance, retirement plans, and paid time off.

- Workplace Safety: Unions can help improve workplace safety by negotiating for better safety equipment, training, and procedures.

- Training and Professional Development: Unions can help their members access training and professional development opportunities to improve their skills and advance their careers.

- Advocacy: Unions can advocate for workers' rights and represent them in disputes with employers, including grievances and legal actions.

- Political Power: Unions can use their collective power to influence public policy and elect politicians who support workers' rights.

Overall, unions can help workers achieve greater economic security, better working conditions, and a stronger voice in the workplace and the broader society.
