Hunter then linked Burisma up with former Clinton administration officials who would work on behalf of Burisma to ""close down for any cases/pursuits against [Burisma owner Zlochevsky] in Ukraine.""

Instead of approaching Hunter Biden like the FBI would do with any other person under investigation, agents were told to *not* approach Hunter and instead wait for his call.

Conveniently, Hunter Biden never called meaning he was never interviewed.

Hunter has no money for child support but has money for this?

Founder of Snctm, Damon Lawner, who sold the club in 2019, identified Hunter Biden as a member.

“Hunter was a member at Snctm and I canceled his membership after 1 party because he’s a scumbag,” Lawner claimed.

The club was created in 2013 after Lawner watched ""Eyes Wide Shut"" where wealthy elites would gather and take part in secretive orgies.

On why he exposed Hunter for being in the club, Lawner said: “Posting what I did on my Instagram about Hunter was me letting people know that the type of behavior that he exhibited was something that upsets me. I knew that the consequences could be me not being part of Snctm anymore, but I was willing to take that risk.”

✔️ The media jumps on board instead of digging deeper.
✔️ The Washington Elites point at the media and say: ""See? The laptop is fake!""

And then to top it all off, Biden (who knows that the entire laptop is real) gets to reference the intel 'experts' during the presidential debate to get off scot-free.
