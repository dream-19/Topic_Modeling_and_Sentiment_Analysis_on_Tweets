marwilliamson,2023-09-25 14:43:09+00:00,"RT @‚ö°Ô∏èIn January 1944, President Franklin D. Roosevelt proposed a second Bill of Rights to secure economic rights for the American People.

In his view, hunger and unemployment were ‚Äúthe stuff of which dictatorships are made.‚Äù

Roosevelt: ‚ÄúThis Republic had its beginning, and grew to its present strength, under the protection of certain inalienable political rights.

As our nation has grown in size and stature, however, these political rights proved inadequate to assure us equality in the pursuit of happiness.

We have accepted, so to speak, a second Bill of Rights under which a new basis of security and prosperity can be established for all, regardless of station, race, or creed.

Among these are:

1) The right to a useful and remunerative job,

2) The right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation,

3) The right of every farmer to raise and sell his products at a return which will give him and his family a decent living,

4) The right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopolies at home or abroad,

5) The right of every family to a decent home,

6) The right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health,

7) The right to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment,

8) The right to a good education.

All of these rights spell security.

And after this war is won, we must be prepared to move forward in the implementation of these rights to new goals of human happiness and well-being.

For unless there is security here at home, there cannot be lasting peace in the world.‚Äù",

Corporate greed is a plague on our society. It acts at this point almost like a single institutionalized force, able to control our government  through its financial influence on Congress, the White House and SCOTUS.

Its tentacles reach into every sector of our society - poisoning our food and water and air; denying Americans health care; flooding our streets with guns; desecrating our environment; denying education and economic prospects to our young; and dominating our foreign affairs.

No, America, things are not okay.

The problem with Cop City is that it would be situated in such away as to be almost impossible to monitor by private citizens.

The problem with Cop City is that it‚Äôs a centralized seat of power in the hands of law enforcement that is already too militarized and slipping out of the control of those it is meant to serve.

marwilliamson,2023-08-07 03:37:19+00:00,"0n August 6, 1945, the United States dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan.
      
I was a teenager when my parents took us there, and I will never forget the pictures  I saw in the commemorative museum. I remember seeing a picture of someone whose left arm had melted into their right arm. And worse‚Ä¶
     
Some who contributed to the making of the atomic bomb actually begged that it not be used, and lived the rest of their lives traumatized by the horror of knowing what had been unleashed.
      
Given the reality at that time, none of us can know what we might‚Äôve done or not done then. The question we need to ask ourselves is not what we think should have happened in the past, but rather what we are doing now, or not doing, to confront the horror of nuclear proliferation in our own time.
      
The average American probably does not know that the United States has somewhere between 5,000 and 7,000 nuclear bombs in our nuclear arsenal now, and most of those would make the bomb dropped on Hiroshima look like a pin prick.
       
When I was growing up, we used to do protests holding huge banners that said ‚ÄúBan the bomb.‚Äù Nuclear nonproliferation - and abolition- can and must once more become our most urgent political goal. 
      
If we ever go down that road again - if nuclear war occurs - humanity will be doomed. In the words of Albert Einstein, ""I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones"".

lawrie_dr,2023-08-04 19:55:39+00:00,"The hug that saved a life In 1995, the twins, Kyrie and Brielle Jackson, were born 12 weeks premature, each weighing only about 2 pounds. They were placed in separate incubators. One twin was not expected to survive. She went into critical condition. Her heart rate was rising while her oxygen level was dropping significantly. They were about to lose her. It was then that one nurse, Gale Kasparian, went against the hospital rules and standard procedure, putting the healthy twin next to her struggling sister in the same incubator. This decision turned out to be life-saving. Once the twins were close to each other, the struggling sister (Brielle) snuggled up to the healthy sister (Kyrie) who put her arms around Brielle. Almost immediately after, Brielle's vital signs started stabilizing. Her heart rate and oxygen levels normalized. Both twin sisters eventually survived and grew into strong young women. The picture below came to be known as the rescuing hug and would change a part of our understanding of medicine.

marwilliamson,2023-06-10 12:10:57+00:00,"The fundamental economic  problem in the United States has less to do with how much money we spend and everything to do with what we spend it on. 

We spend huge amounts on things that reduce the life force of the nation: tax cuts for the wealthy, corporate subsidies, and war. 

Meanwhile, we withhold money from things that  help people thrive, and thus create more good/produce more money themselves: health, education, and the well being of our communities.

America is in a decline because we continue to do things that decrease the wellbeing of our people -- all so that a ridiculously small portion of our population can do better and better.

We will not pull out of our decline until and unless we are willing to fundamentally change. 

We will either continue to fall - and make no mistake about it, our political status quo is a trajectory of decline - or we will consciously and proactively rise.

marwilliamson,2023-06-10 13:58:26+00:00,"Tax cuts to the very wealthy are given under the canard that those people will then create more jobs and add to the economy. 

Evidence is clearly otherwise. The 2017 tax cut - where 83 cents of every dollar went into the hands of the wealthiest Individuals and corporations - will never pay for itself. Giving tax cuts to companies already making billions in profit did not make them invest; the money mainly went to stock buybacks etc. 

When corporatists talk about reducing the deficit, they are only willing to do so on the backs of the middle class and poor. They are never willing to spend money on catching wealthy tax cheats, repealing unfair tax cuts to the very wealthy, or increasing investment in things that actually support the average person in creating more wealth. 

The problem is not one individual policy here or there. The problem is big picture: a state of aristocracy and corporate entitlement now baked into the cake in America - the  very opposite of a free democratic society in which everyone is supposed to have a fair shot. 

The current system makes a mockery of the very idea of ""unalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.""

As the late Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis said, ""We can have democracy in this country, or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can't have both.""

Today, we're issuing a statement in response to the federal indictment of former President Donald J. Trump.

‚ÄúThe indictment of a former president on charges related to the Espionage Act is a sobering development.¬† All Americans - regardless of our political affiliation - should be hoping for a fair and impartial trial for the former president. Mr. Trump and his lawyers have the right to defend his case in court, and all of us as citizens have the responsibility to honor our criminal codes of justice.

No person is above the law, and all are innocent until proven guilty. Both apply to the former president, as they apply to every American. The law should be a nuanced instrument, not a meat cleaver, and it should never be an instrument of personal grievance. Such a case as this, if prosecuted unfairly, could set a dangerous precedent; it is to every American's benefit, therefore, that Mr. Trump receives equal justice before the law.

The special prosecutor in this case, Jack Smith, is a registered Independent and is not working at the behest of the Biden Administration. Such charges are false, and those who are making them know that. A grand jury made the decision to indict. The goal of the system is to be an impartial witness to the facts. I have no doubt that those involved in the indictment have done their best to achieve that, and that those who will be involved in the trial going forward will seek a similarly high standard of justice.‚Äù",915.0
