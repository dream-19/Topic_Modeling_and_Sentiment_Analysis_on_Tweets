Corporate greed is a plague on our society. It acts at this point almost like a single institutionalized force, able to control our government  through its financial influence on Congress, the White House and SCOTUS.

Its tentacles reach into every sector of our society - poisoning our food and water and air; denying Americans health care; flooding our streets with guns; desecrating our environment; denying education and economic prospects to our young; and dominating our foreign affairs.

No, America, things are not okay. 

This is the 11th hour but it isn't midnight yet. Things can still be put right - but not by electing a status quo politician. 

The status quo will not disrupt itself.

It's time for the people to step in.

There's a reason why 75% of Americans support the strike; people on both Right and Left have begun to realize that the axis of opposition in this country isn't Right ver Left but rather Up versus Down. 

The profound income inequality now baked into the cake in this country is being rejected not by status quo politicians but by the American people. At a time of overarching economic injustice, there is a rising up of New Labor to push back against it.

39,marwilliamson,2023-09-18 15:24:45+00:00,"The problem with Cop City is not that it supports law-enforcement. 

The problem with Cop City is that it separates law-enforcement from the rest of the community in a way that will foster an “us versus them” attitude. Law enforcement should always be “of” the community.

The problem with Cop City is that it would be situated in such away as to be almost impossible to monitor by private citizens.

The problem with Cop City is that it’s a centralized seat of power in the hands of law enforcement that is already too militarized and slipping out of the control of those it is meant to serve.

Even now - and it hasn’t even been built yet - Cop City is backed by forces abusing the rights of our people to protest it. 

Cop City represents the worst kind of marriage of corporate and governmental power, a prelude to fascism and the template for a police state. In the wrong hands it would be a training center for urban warfare against our own people. 

Cop Cities do not belong in a free society. They do not belong in the United States of America."

Training our police officers, firefighters, and first responders should not be controversial - or political.

Given that the fate of the country and the species are directly impacted by continued fossil fuel extraction, I will use the powers of the presidency - through an official declaration of a Climate Emergency - to override Big Oil’s nefarious and immoral disregard of the severity of the crisis.

428,marwilliamson,2023-08-07 03:37:19+00:00,"0n August 6, 1945, the United States dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan.
      
I was a teenager when my parents took us there, and I will never forget the pictures  I saw in the commemorative museum. I remember seeing a picture of someone whose left arm had melted into their right arm. And worse…
     
Some who contributed to the making of the atomic bomb actually begged that it not be used, and lived the rest of their lives traumatized by the horror of knowing what had been unleashed.
      
Given the reality at that time, none of us can know what we might’ve done or not done then. The question we need to ask ourselves is not what we think should have happened in the past, but rather what we are doing now, or not doing, to confront the horror of nuclear proliferation in our own time.
      
The average American probably does not know that the United States has somewhere between 5,000 and 7,000 nuclear bombs in our nuclear arsenal now, and most of those would make the bomb dropped on Hiroshima look like a pin prick.
       
When I was growing up, we used to do protests holding huge banners that said “Ban the bomb.” Nuclear nonproliferation - and abolition- can and must once more become our most urgent political goal. 
      
If we ever go down that road again - if nuclear war occurs - humanity will be doomed. In the words of Albert Einstein, ""I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones"".

467,lawrie_dr,2023-08-04 19:55:39+00:00,"The hug that saved a life In 1995, the twins, Kyrie and Brielle Jackson, were born 12 weeks premature, each weighing only about 2 pounds. They were placed in separate incubators. One twin was not expected to survive. She went into critical condition. Her heart rate was rising while her oxygen level was dropping significantly. They were about to lose her. It was then that one nurse, Gale Kasparian, went against the hospital rules and standard procedure, putting the healthy twin next to her struggling sister in the same incubator. This decision turned out to be life-saving. Once the twins were close to each other, the struggling sister (Brielle) snuggled up to the healthy sister (Kyrie) who put her arms around Brielle. Almost immediately after, Brielle's vital signs started stabilizing. Her heart rate and oxygen levels normalized. Both twin sisters eventually survived and grew into strong young women. The picture below came to be known as the rescuing hug and would change a part of our understanding of medicine.

Hugging that is coming from the heart is proven to have calming and healing effects. Maybe there is someone in your life that can use a warm and heartfelt hug right now."

The real dichotomy is between the powerful and the powerless, between those who have capital and easy access to capital versus those who are always struggling to survive.

Our current system maintains the dichotomy,  leaving a huge amount of suffering  baked into the cake. Only an uprising at the ballot box (in addition to the resurgence in the labor movement) can change the calculus.

484,marwilliamson,2023-08-03 17:45:45+00:00,"Rural America used to be part of the American dream, not the American nightmare. 

Before the 1980s if a farmer had a poor yield one year a local bank was likely to say, “Don’t worry about it, you’ll pay me next year.” And the federal govt routinely granted loans with additional grants to help local farmers.

But the sinister marriage of big banks and Big Ag obliterated that humane reality, swallowing up small local banks and showing no mercy, forcing farmers to sell out to Big Ag in a tragic hostile takeover of one of the most important sectors of our society.

The corporatization of agriculture and food production has been devastating for farming and food, destroying whole communities and millions of people’s lives.  

It’s time for a u-turn - time for a generation to face what has is happened in this country and to turn this ship around."

But there has always been a mean streak among us as well, a collective shadow side that has produced horrors of injustice. Individually, too often our rugged individualism has become rugged narcissism, we acquiesce within ourselves to some of the lowest human traits, and we’re willing to normalize in government and society what should be considered intolerable behavior.

MLK Jr. said “we need quantitative changes in our circumstances and qualitative shifts in our souls.” Never more so than now. The first place we need to clean up is our own hearts. We need personal transformation as much as transactional political change. Without the former, the latter will not occur on any fundamental basis.

And the time to work on both is now."

We spend huge amounts on things that reduce the life force of the nation: tax cuts for the wealthy, corporate subsidies, and war. 

Meanwhile, we withhold money from things that  help people thrive, and thus create more good/produce more money themselves: health, education, and the well being of our communities.

America is in a decline because we continue to do things that decrease the wellbeing of our people -- all so that a ridiculously small portion of our population can do better and better.

We will not pull out of our decline until and unless we are willing to fundamentally change. 

We will either continue to fall - and make no mistake about it, our political status quo is a trajectory of decline - or we will consciously and proactively rise. 

The decision lies in each of our hands."
908,marwilliamson,2023-06-10 13:58:26+00:00,"Tax cuts to the very wealthy are given under the canard that those people will then create more jobs and add to the economy. 

Evidence is clearly otherwise. The 2017 tax cut - where 83 cents of every dollar went into the hands of the wealthiest Individuals and corporations - will never pay for itself. Giving tax cuts to companies already making billions in profit did not make them invest; the money mainly went to stock buybacks etc. 

When corporatists talk about reducing the deficit, they are only willing to do so on the backs of the middle class and poor. They are never willing to spend money on catching wealthy tax cheats, repealing unfair tax cuts to the very wealthy, or increasing investment in things that actually support the average person in creating more wealth. 

The problem is not one individual policy here or there. The problem is big picture: a state of aristocracy and corporate entitlement now baked into the cake in America - the  very opposite of a free democratic society in which everyone is supposed to have a fair shot. 

The current system makes a mockery of the very idea of ""unalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.""

As the late Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis said, ""We can have democracy in this country, or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can't have both.""

Today, we're issuing a statement in response to the federal indictment of former President Donald J. Trump.

“The indictment of a former president on charges related to the Espionage Act is a sobering development.  All Americans - regardless of our political affiliation - should be hoping for a fair and impartial trial for the former president. Mr. Trump and his lawyers have the right to defend his case in court, and all of us as citizens have the responsibility to honor our criminal codes of justice.

No person is above the law, and all are innocent until proven guilty. Both apply to the former president, as they apply to every American. The law should be a nuanced instrument, not a meat cleaver, and it should never be an instrument of personal grievance. Such a case as this, if prosecuted unfairly, could set a dangerous precedent; it is to every American's benefit, therefore, that Mr. Trump receives equal justice before the law.

The special prosecutor in this case, Jack Smith, is a registered Independent and is not working at the behest of the Biden Administration. Such charges are false, and those who are making them know that. A grand jury made the decision to indict. The goal of the system is to be an impartial witness to the facts. I have no doubt that those involved in the indictment have done their best to achieve that, and that those who will be involved in the trial going forward will seek a similarly high standard of justice.”"
