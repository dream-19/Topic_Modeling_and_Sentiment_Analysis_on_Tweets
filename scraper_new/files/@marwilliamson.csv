Corporate greed is a plague on our society. It acts at this point almost like a single institutionalized force, able to control our government  through its financial influence on Congress, the White House and SCOTUS.

Its tentacles reach into every sector of our society - poisoning our food and water and air; denying Americans health care; flooding our streets with guns; desecrating our environment; denying education and economic prospects to our young; and dominating our foreign affairs.

No, America, things are not okay. 

This is the 11th hour but it isn't midnight yet. Things can still be put right - but not by electing a status quo politician. 

The status quo will not disrupt itself.

The profound income inequality now baked into the cake in this country is being rejected not by status quo politicians but by the American people. At a time of overarching economic injustice, there is a rising up of New Labor to push back against it.

The problem with Cop City is that it separates law-enforcement from the rest of the community in a way that will foster an ‚Äúus versus them‚Äù attitude. Law enforcement should always be ‚Äúof‚Äù the community.

The problem with Cop City is that it would be situated in such away as to be almost impossible to monitor by private citizens.

The problem with Cop City is that it‚Äôs a centralized seat of power in the hands of law enforcement that is already too militarized and slipping out of the control of those it is meant to serve.

Even now - and it hasn‚Äôt even been built yet - Cop City is backed by forces abusing the rights of our people to protest it. 

Cop City represents the worst kind of marriage of corporate and governmental power, a prelude to fascism and the template for a police state. In the wrong hands it would be a training center for urban warfare against our own people.

marwilliamson,2023-08-07 03:37:19+00:00,"0n August 6, 1945, the United States dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan.
      
I was a teenager when my parents took us there, and I will never forget the pictures  I saw in the commemorative museum. I remember seeing a picture of someone whose left arm had melted into their right arm. And worse‚Ä¶
     
Some who contributed to the making of the atomic bomb actually begged that it not be used, and lived the rest of their lives traumatized by the horror of knowing what had been unleashed.
      
Given the reality at that time, none of us can know what we might‚Äôve done or not done then. The question we need to ask ourselves is not what we think should have happened in the past, but rather what we are doing now, or not doing, to confront the horror of nuclear proliferation in our own time.
      
The average American probably does not know that the United States has somewhere between 5,000 and 7,000 nuclear bombs in our nuclear arsenal now, and most of those would make the bomb dropped on Hiroshima look like a pin prick.
       
When I was growing up, we used to do protests holding huge banners that said ‚ÄúBan the bomb.‚Äù Nuclear nonproliferation - and abolition- can and must once more become our most urgent political goal. 
      
If we ever go down that road again - if nuclear war occurs - humanity will be doomed. In the words of Albert Einstein, ""I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones"".

lawrie_dr,2023-08-04 19:55:39+00:00,"The hug that saved a life In 1995, the twins, Kyrie and Brielle Jackson, were born 12 weeks premature, each weighing only about 2 pounds. They were placed in separate incubators. One twin was not expected to survive. She went into critical condition. Her heart rate was rising while her oxygen level was dropping significantly. They were about to lose her. It was then that one nurse, Gale Kasparian, went against the hospital rules and standard procedure, putting the healthy twin next to her struggling sister in the same incubator. This decision turned out to be life-saving. Once the twins were close to each other, the struggling sister (Brielle) snuggled up to the healthy sister (Kyrie) who put her arms around Brielle. Almost immediately after, Brielle's vital signs started stabilizing. Her heart rate and oxygen levels normalized. Both twin sisters eventually survived and grew into strong young women. The picture below came to be known as the rescuing hug and would change a part of our understanding of medicine.

Hugging that is coming from the heart is proven to have calming and healing effects. Maybe there is someone in your life that can use a warm and heartfelt hug right now.",461.0

marwilliamson,2023-08-04 07:42:32+00:00,"The political axis that defines our times is not between left and right. That is simply a smokescreen. 

The real dichotomy is between the powerful and the powerless, between those who have capital and easy access to capital versus those who are always struggling to survive.

Our current system maintains the dichotomy,  leaving a huge amount of suffering  baked into the cake. Only an uprising at the ballot box (in addition to the resurgence in the labor movement) can change the calculus.

marwilliamson,2023-08-03 17:45:45+00:00,"Rural America used to be part of the American dream, not the American nightmare. 

Before the 1980s if a farmer had a poor yield one year a local bank was likely to say, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it, you‚Äôll pay me next year.‚Äù And the federal govt routinely granted loans with additional grants to help local farmers.

But the sinister marriage of big banks and Big Ag obliterated that humane reality, swallowing up small local banks and showing no mercy, forcing farmers to sell out to Big Ag in a tragic hostile takeover of one of the most important sectors of our society.

The corporatization of agriculture and food production has been devastating for farming and food, destroying whole communities and millions of people‚Äôs lives.  

It‚Äôs time for a u-turn - time for a generation to face what has is happened in this country and to turn this ship around.",479.0
