KamalaHarris,2023-07-01 17:42:15+00:00,"Extreme abortion laws have denied the women of our country care even when their life and health were at risk.  

Women like Kristen from Texas, who, during her miscarriage, was rushed to the emergency room and was turned away after the hospital consulted with their lawyers about criminal liability under her state’s extreme ban. Kristen only received care after she developed sepsis—an infection that could have killed her.  

Women like Anya from Florida, who, after her water broke prematurely, was also rushed to the emergency room. She was told, sadly, that she would lose her pregnancy and she could die. She was also turned away and refused treatment because of Florida’s extreme abortion law. Hours later, Anya nearly bled to death in a public bathroom after a miscarriage.  

I know these stories are difficult to hear. And they’re difficult to tell. But there are people every day who are being subjected to judgment, being made to feel as though they should be silent—when in fact they shouldn’t have to have those experiences. We can’t stand for that. We can’t tolerate that. It’s just not right.  

While Americans continue to make their voices heard across our nation, President Biden and I will continue to do our part to protect abortion access and reproductive rights."
