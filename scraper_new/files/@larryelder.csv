The Department of Justice initiated the Biden family coverup, and now DHS, under the leadership of Secretary Mayorkas, is complicit in it.

IRS whistleblowers provided testimony regarding misconduct during the Hunter Biden criminal investigation, including FBI HQ tipping off Secret Service HQ and the Biden transition team about the planned Hunter Biden interview. Following these actions, the interview of Hunter Biden did not occur.

These allegations were backed up by the former FBI supervisory special agent who was assigned to interview Hunter Biden.

After months of obstruction by DHS and the Secret Service, @RepJamesComer is issuing six subpoenas.

4‚É£ Subpoenas to DHS that require the production of documents and communications about our request and three depositions with DHS employees.

2‚É£ Subpoenas to the Secret Service requiring two Secret Service employees to appear for depositions.

jonathanhatami,2023-08-25 20:13:55+00:00,"George Gasc√≥n has recently allowed ‚Äúexceptions‚Äù to the filing of ‚Äúspecial circumstances‚Äù in very recent & tragic murders that have been in the media. Now, many families whose loved ones have been killed in LA, whose cases aren‚Äôt in the media, are asking ‚Äúwhat about my child‚Äôs case?‚Äù 

When Gasc√≥n took office, he promised to stop filing special circumstances on ALL cases no matter what. Special circumstances are aggravated forms of murder like torturing a child to death, murdering an innocent person because of her race or religion, killing a police officer, molesting or raping a child or adult & then murdering her, or a serial murderer. If convicted, the sentence is Life Without the Possibility of Parole (LWOP) or capital punishment. 

Gasc√≥n said a person who intentionally tortures & murders a child ‚Äúevolves‚Äù & should be released from custody at some point. 

Without collaborating with victim‚Äôs families, DDA‚Äôs or law enforcement, or even looking at the evidence in a case, on day 1, Gasc√≥n ordered all special circumstances on pre-existing cases to be removed & disallowed the filing of special circumstances on any new cases. Gasc√≥n said he had a ‚Äúmandate from the public,‚Äù even though the last time Californians voted on adding special circumstances in 2000, 72.5% (5 million people) voted for it.

This blanket (no exception) policy lasted for almost 2 yrs until media pressure caused Gasc√≥n to flip-flop & now he‚Äôs making exceptions. Many cases, including the torture & murder of Anthony Avalos, Gasc√≥n didn‚Äôt make an exception. In Anthony‚Äôs case, I just ignored his unethical order & this year in a trial, Anthony‚Äôs murderers were convicted of murder & the special circumstance was found true. If it was up to Gasc√≥n, Anthony‚Äôs killers would have been eligible for parole at some point. That would have been an injustice. But bc Anthony was not famous or rich, Gasc√≥n didn‚Äôt really care. 

Why do I point this out? Gasc√≥n has denied equal justice for so many families. His blanket policies weren‚Äôt a reform. They were an injustice. Just because your case is in the media, or because the victim or defendant is famous or wealthy, that should NEVER be the reason to file charges, allegations & special circumstances. It should always be based on evidence & the law. 

All of us deserve EQUAL justice under the law. ALL of us. Gasc√≥n must go.

‚Ä¢ Black unemployment fell to an all time low
‚Ä¢ He secured our borders, keeping out illegal alien labor that depresses the wages of black and brown Americans in the inner city
‚Ä¢ He supported school choice, which studies show increases black graduation rates
‚Ä¢ He passed the First Step Act, which allowed 5,000 nonviolent inmates, who were mostly black, to have their sentenced reduced by an average of 70 months
‚Ä¢ He pardoned Jack Johnson, the first black heavyweight champ
