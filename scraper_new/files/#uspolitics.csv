serpunketh,2023-09-24 02:23:09+00:00,"üá∫üá∏ Exploring the Downsides of US Politics Incentives ü§î

I asked ChatGPT about the flaws in America's political incentive structure, and here's what it shared:

Now, how would YOU tweak these incentives for a better political landscape? üëáüèøüó≥Ô∏èüí¨ #USPolitics #Incentives #ChangeTheGame

The incentive structure in American politics, like in any political system, is complex and can have both positive and negative consequences. Here are some of the downfalls or challenges associated with the current incentive structure in American politics:

1. Partisanship and Polarization: One significant issue is the incentive for politicians to prioritize party loyalty over bipartisan cooperation. In a highly polarized environment, politicians may fear primary challenges from within their own party if they are seen as compromising with the opposing party, leading to gridlock and dysfunction in government.

1. Short-Term Focus: Elected officials often face incentives to prioritize short-term gains and reelection over long-term policy solutions. This can lead to a focus on quick wins and policies that appeal to their base rather than addressing complex, long-term challenges.

3. Fundraising Pressure: Political campaigns require significant funding, and candidates often spend a considerable amount of time fundraising. This can lead to concerns about undue influence from wealthy donors or special interest groups and may detract from time spent on policymaking.

4. Negative Campaigning: The current incentive structure sometimes rewards negative campaigning and attack ads. Candidates may find that attacking opponents is an effective way to gain media attention and energize their base.

5. Incumbency Advantage: Incumbent politicians often have a built-in advantage, making it challenging for new or third-party candidates to compete. This can lead to a lack of competitive elections and reduced accountability.

6. Media and Sensationalism: Media outlets may have incentives to prioritize sensational or controversial stories over substantive policy discussions. This can contribute to the focus on personality-driven politics rather than policy issues.

7. Gerrymandering: Incentives for state legislators to draw district boundaries in ways that favor their own party can result in uncompetitive districts and reduce political accountability.

8. Lobbying and Special Interests: The influence of lobbying groups and special interests can be significant, as they have the resources and incentives to shape policy decisions in their favor, potentially at the expense of the broader public interest.

9. Primary Systems: Primary elections can lead to the selection of candidates who appeal to the more extreme elements of their party's base, potentially making it difficult for more moderate candidates to succeed in general elections.

10. Lack of Civic Engagement: The current incentive structure may not always encourage high levels of civic engagement and voter turnout, as some voters may feel disillusioned or believe that their voices do not matter.

These are some of the challenges associated with the current incentive structure in American politics. 
Addressing these issues often requires comprehensive political and electoral reforms, as well as changes in political culture and public expectations.

OccupyDemocrats,2023-09-19 16:24:17+00:00,"BREAKING: Rudy Giuliani is slammed with disastrous news as the law firm that represented him amidst his numerous investigations and lawsuits sues him for a staggering $1.3 million in unpaid legal fees.

The timing could not be any worse for Giuliani as he is currently drowning financially. For example, on the day he was arraigned in Georgia he was seen leaving a bail bonds office ‚Äî indicating that he is likely dead broke.

The law firm Davidoff Hutcher & Citron alleges that Giuliani has only paid $214,000 of the money he owes them for numerous services, including helping him with the January 6th investigation, 2021 investigations by Georgia prosecutors, and numerous other problems.

Despite his massive outstanding bill of $1,360,196, Giuliani's most recent payment to the firm was made four days ago and was for the relatively paltry sum of $10,000, meaning he hardly made a dent.

Giuliani's spokesman Ted Goodman pathetically whined about the lawsuit on Giuliani's behalf‚Äî

""I can‚Äôt express how personally hurt I am by what Bob Costello has done. It‚Äôs a real shame when lawyers do things like this, and all I will say is that their bill is way in excess to anything approaching legitimate fees,"" he said.""

The man once known as ""America's mayor"" is well and truly cooked. The good news for Rudy is that meals in prison are free. 

Please retweet and ‚ù§Ô∏è if you think that Giuliani deserves jail time ‚Äî and consider joining the growing exodus to Tribel, a ‚Äúwoke‚Äù new Twitter competitor that is exploding in popularity because it banned Trump for life and because Elon Musk banned Tribel‚Äôs Twitter account ‚Äî but he forgot to ban this link to download the new Tribel app: https://t.co/HnJzSKjCwX",252.0

Joe Biden Claimed Credit On 3/2/2023

Only One Problem, Donald Trump Capped Insulin At $35 On 5/26/2020
‚Äå
Don‚Äôt Be Fooled By The Lies. Here‚Äôs The Video Footage From All 3:
‚Äå
5/26/2020 Donald Trump: $35 a month for hundreds and thousands of seniors enrolled in Medicare. That's a big deal. Participating plans will cap cost at just $35 a month per type of insulin. And some plans may offer it free. So for everybody that was getting ripped off and paying tremendous prices, senior citizens. But guess what? Instead of $400 to $500 a month, they're going to pay $35 a month.
‚Äå
03/02/2023 Joe Biden ü§°: Here's the deal. I called on the prescription drug companies to bring down the price of insulin to $35 to everyone, not just seniors. And today, Eli Lilly, the largest manufacturer of insulin in United States of America, agreed to do just that. Thirty-five bucks.
‚Äå
09/14/2023 @RepJeffries ü§° : House Democrats met with Secretary Becerra to talk about implementation of our efforts to negotiate lower drug prices for everyday Americans to strengthen access to affordable health care, and to discuss our efforts around things like capping the cost of insulin for everyday Americans at $35 a month. That's how House Democrats spent this morning House Republicans spent this morning talking about their illegitimate impeachment inquiry which is nothing more than a partisan political stunt. Because there's no evidence of wrongdoing with respect to President Biden.",449.0

But it gets even WORSE for Donald Trump‚Ä¶

The lawsuit was filed in Minnesota ‚Äî and the Minnesota Secretary of State just announced that he will remove Trump from the ballot if the Minnesota Supreme Court rules that he can. Legal experts are already saying that this will create a ‚Äúdomino effect‚Äù that can lead to Trump being removed from the ballot ‚Äúin all 50 states.‚Äù 

To make matters worse for Trump, Harvard‚Äôs most famous Constitutional Law expert says that the lawsuit is ‚Äúrock solid as a legal matter, relying entirely on existing law and indisputable facts of public record.""

The lawsuit is going to be heard by the Minnesota Supreme Court ‚Äî and it demands that the court immediately remove Trump from the Minnesota ballot for engaging in insurrection, declaring, ‚Äú""Donald J. Trump, through his words and actions, after swearing an oath as an officer of the United States to support the Constitution, engaged in insurrection or rebellion, or gave aid and comfort to its enemies, as defined by Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment.‚Äù

Well said. America MUST never allow a traitorous insurrectionist anywhere near our presidential ballots. 

Please retweet and ‚ù§Ô∏è if you support this lawsuit ‚Äî and consider joining the growing exodus to Tribel, a ‚Äúwoke‚Äù new Twitter competitor that is exploding in popularity because it banned Trump for life and because Elon Musk banned Tribel‚Äôs Twitter account ‚Äî but he forgot to ban this link to download the new Tribel app: https://t.co/HnJzSKjCwX",462.0

Matt_HorwoodET,2023-09-13 06:30:50+00:00,"Last year I emailed the Canadian Anti-Hate Network to ask how they defined the ""far-right,"" and if they were at all concerned with the potential for left-wing extremism in Canada. Here's the full response I received from CAHN's Executive Director Evan Balgord:

The far-right movement sees itself as the true people fighting against a corrupt ruling class.

(Nothing wrong with that first part. Populism isn't necessarily a bad thing.)

It is tolerant of racism, antisemitism, misogyny and anti-LGBTQ+ sentiments in its midst, either because they are embraced, seen as less important than maintaining movement cohesion, or because the allegations are seen themselves as an invention of corrupt media. They see their opposition as unCanadian and undeserving of rights, and that often extends to equity-deserving groups. They want to take power (in an election or not) and use that power to persecute their enemies. They are against democratic norms like the institution of journalism and the peaceful transition of power. Many of them discuss putting their enemies on trial for treason and hardline elements say they want to ‚Äúgenocide‚Äù them.

So the far-right isn't regular small-c conservatism, unless you think regular conservatism is tolerant of racism and wants to do away with democracy. I think it's the responsibility of regular conservatives to make sure those lines don't blur and to protect their position from extremists.

The far-right movement is a threat to democracy and elements within it inspire the vast majority of modern-day Ideologically Motivated Violent Extremism (IMVE), including mass murders.

(What's attributed or blamed on the 'far-left' doesn't even come close. Go take a look at CSIS statements, or the FBIs).

The ideologies of the far-right movement and the racist, anti-women, and anti-LGBTQ+ beliefs inside it are often based on simplistic, conspiratorial interpretations of the world that replicate by the spread of disinformation and misinformation.

We have always been very clear that not every convoy supporter or antivaxxer is a racist or a white supremacist. I have empathy for people who have lost their jobs or relationships because they started to believe in conspiracies. People have real and valid grievances that our politics are failing to address, especially those stemming from income inequality. The empty promises of the far-right are, understandably, appealing - and can attract otherwise intelligent people. We need a real political alternative that would make everyone's lives significantly better.",730.0

Gerashchenko_en,2023-09-13 17:04:30+00:00,"What distinguishes a civilized person from a barbarian?

How did humans become humans? What do we understand by that?

They say that a true ""human"" was made when altruism appeared - when people started taking care of the weak, treat the sick and help the old ones survive.

Humanism and humanistic values mean perceiving another as a personality, too. Compassion, empathy.

Barbarianism is consumption. Using another as a resource.Taking away everything they can - things, territories, lives.

This is the right of the strong. Hierarchy, not unlike a prison one. Collective denial of responsibility: ""what do we have to do with that"", ""it's all Putin"", ""they're just acting on orders"", ""these sanctions against regular people are such a shame"", ""it's not all so black-and-white""...

Civilization opposes barbarianism.

One of the main ways to counteract, I think, are with empathy and compassion. The ability to put oneself in another's shoes. Not being able to walk past, pretending not seeing violence and injustice. Seeing how the future is shaped by our actions today.

Ukraine is civilization's outpost today. We defend Western humanistic values.

This is not a war for territories. This is a war for what future will look like. Which values will prevail in the future. Will civilization survive or will humanity be immersed in barbarianism once more?",741.0

YourAnonNews,2023-09-11 15:28:38+00:00,"Yes.  We posted 9/11 memes that pissed people off.  They were meant to piss people off.  9/11 was a turning point for the entire world, not just the USA.
Unjust wars, unjust wire taps, torture, imprisonment of the innocent, and the rise of an out-of-control surveillance state.
The American people rallied behind the lies of the Bush administration, destabilizing an entire region which lead to the rise of ISIS.  Nearly 500,000 people died in Iraq because of a lie that was pushed about ""weapons of mass destruction,"" of which Bush himself would admit that there wasn't any.  ""Whoops, my bad.""
9/11 should really piss people off - not just because of how many Americans died in 2001, but because it nailed the coffin shut on any freedoms the USA ever had.  There was a time when the USA didn't have cameras watching your every movement.  There was a time when the USA wasn't allowed to unlawfully surveil it's own citizens.
The Bush lies made it easy for the Trump lies to take root.  One very hard fact for people to swallow is that Obama could have very easily gone after the Bush administration for war crimes, and instead of perpetuating the war in the Middle East, he could have resolved it.  Instead, Obama became known as the president that droned the fuck out of innocent families.  Only later to take the title of ""I caught Osama Bin Ladin but dumped his body in the ocean.""
The conspiracies from the right wing are constantly fueled.  From the 9/11 truther movement, to the anti-vax Covid-19 truther movement, to the anti-maskers - to the Sandy Hook shootings being a staged event: it's a slap in the face to logical reasoning and common sense.
In a lot of ways, 9/11 lead up to why we have two ancient relics running for office, one far right-wing dictator and an ancient centrist who is trying to act progressive.  So - go ahead and mourn not just the loss of those 2,996 souls who died on September 11, 2001 - mourn for the loss of the innocents who were obliterated because of the lies of Bush, and the perpetuation of the unjust wars by Obama too.
The amount of life lost because of these wars is staggering.  Mourn the innocent. Mourn the loss of your freedoms.",950.0

An important commentary by a British reporter living and working in Russia on the state of Western journalism in covering the Ukraine War. #cdnpolitics #USPolitics",1063.0
johnnyjmils,2023-09-08 18:50:45+00:00,"Predictions tend to make fools of us all, so I don‚Äôt make many. But back in march I tweeted this. Many in the alternative press and military analysts on X knew it too. The failed Ukrainian counter offensive has not just been a disaster for Ukraine. It has been a monumental failure of NATO intelligence and has laid bare the intellectual ineptitude of the Western mainstream press. How could this have happened?

I did expect Ukraine to have more success than they did. And many Russians did too. When I drove through Zaphorozhie region recently I saw newly dug defensive lines as far south as the Black Sea. They were prepared.

I‚Äôve spent must of the last year in Donbass. It‚Äôs tough on the frontlines. Much tougher than Russia would like to admit. War is hell. 

But the reality is that insufficient air or artillery superiority, Ukrainian generals warning they weren‚Äôt ready. A year long self deluding media campaign about the incompetency of the Russian army. It was clear to those in the know it would be a disaster. If ukriane did have success, Russia has such great reserves they would have reversed it. 

Absurd, deluded articles about Russian conscripts who would apparently flee British Challenger 2‚Äôs. Think tanks obsessed with the propaganda war while Russia lays millions of mines.

Anyone who even suggests peace is labeled a Kremlin asset. Meaning anyone in politics, journalism or civil society who questions the inept and self destructive policies risks losing their job and their ability to support their families. This isn‚Äôt freedom. It‚Äôs a fear culture. A form of intellectual lobotomy that is destroying Britains ability to form prosperous policy. 

The shocking standard of British reporting is damaging British interests by being so inept in their judgements. By attempting to fool the public they are also fooling themselves and members of parliament. Most of whom know little of international affairs bar what they read in these same papers. 

As a reporter in Donbass I was often asked to comment on events elsewhere in Ukraine. I would look at the mainstream press to do so as they have many reporters in Ukraine. Over the course of the war I have simply found them too unreliable to treat as credible sources. When a Ukrainian missile hit an apartment block around the corner from me in Donetsk. And a certain outlet casually blamed it on Russia it was the last straw. 

There are some outstanding mainstream journalists and many super nice people but the editorial standards are ruining their institutions reputations. Which is why people are flocking elsewhere for their news. Instead of rectifying this by reporting more honestly, they try to discredit the outlets people go to instead. It‚Äôs a self defeating and ultimately doomed strategy. 

More so, if the British MOD really thought they could succeed then it has been an intelligence failure on a monumental scale.

We now see reports coming out about why it has failed. It was clear to the rest of us before it started. 

Europe is suffering a crisis of leadership. Corporations and big money have become too powerful. And we have shipped out our foreign policy to the US. Naively believing their interests are the same as ours. They are not. 

There are few real European patriots left in positions of power or in the media. And even fewer with the courage and intellectual ability to read the changing tides of history and of the new path that Europe must inevitably plough.",1064.0

Welcome to EVERY border town in America.  

We have been living this for years! 

We have been struggling with Biden‚Äôs dereliction to secure our border for years.  

We have been warning the nation for years.  

And now the self inflicted migrant crisis is overwhelming New York and other so-called sanctuary cities.  

The Biden Administration did this.  

The Biden Administration is responsible for the human trafficking, drug smuggling, crime, violence, and the rape of women and children along the southern border.  

The Biden Administration even welded open gates at the southern border to encourage the practice of illegal immigration.  They are actively engaged in the subversion of federal immigration law, not the enforcement of it.  

So to Mayor Adams, and to all other Democrat mayors and governors throughout this country.  If you are truly interested in helping to end this crisis, then denounce the Biden Administration and work with us to finally secure this border.  

When a Republican speaks the way Adams did about the illegal immigration crisis we are laughed at, scorned, and labeled xenophobic.  

It will be fascinating to see how the media interprets his speech on the matter.",1197.0

CalltoActivism,2023-09-04 21:43:04+00:00,"A British writer penned the best description of Donald Trump I‚Äôve ever read:

‚ÄúWhy do some British people not like Donald Trump?‚Äù 

A few things spring to mind. Trump lacks certain qualities which the British traditionally esteem. For instance, he has no class, no charm, no coolness, no credibility, no compassion, no wit, no warmth, no wisdom, no subtlety, no sensitivity, no self-awareness, no humility, no honour and no grace ‚Äì all qualities, funnily enough, with which his predecessor Mr. Obama was generously blessed. So for us, the stark contrast does rather throw Trump‚Äôs limitations into embarrassingly sharp relief. 

Plus, we like a laugh. And while Trump may be laughable, he has never once said anything wry, witty or even faintly amusing ‚Äì not once, ever. I don‚Äôt say that rhetorically, I mean it quite literally: not once, not ever. And that fact is particularly disturbing to the British sensibility ‚Äì for us, to lack humour is almost inhuman. But with Trump, it‚Äôs a fact. He doesn‚Äôt even seem to understand what a joke is ‚Äì his idea of a joke is a crass comment, an illiterate insult, a casual act of cruelty. 

Trump is a troll. And like all trolls, he is never funny and he never laughs; he only crows or jeers. And scarily, he doesn‚Äôt just talk in crude, witless insults ‚Äì he actually thinks in them. His mind is a simple bot-like algorithm of petty prejudices and knee-jerk nastiness. 

There is never any under-layer of irony, complexity, nuance or depth. It‚Äôs all surface. Some Americans might see this as refreshingly upfront. Well, we don‚Äôt. We see it as having no inner world, no soul. And in Britain we traditionally side with David, not Goliath. All our heroes are plucky underdogs: Robin Hood, Dick Whittington, Oliver Twist. Trump is neither plucky, nor an underdog. He is the exact opposite of that. He‚Äôs not even a spoiled rich-boy, or a greedy fat-cat. He‚Äôs more a fat white slug. A Jabba the Hutt of privilege.

And worse, he is that most unforgivable of all things to the British: a bully. That is, except when he is among bullies; then he suddenly transforms into a snivelling sidekick instead. There are unspoken rules to this stuff ‚Äì the Queensberry rules of basic decency ‚Äì and he breaks them all. He punches downwards ‚Äì which a gentleman should, would, could never do ‚Äì and every blow he aims is below the belt. He particularly likes to kick the vulnerable or voiceless ‚Äì and he kicks them when they are down.

So the fact that a significant minority ‚Äì perhaps a third ‚Äì of Americans look at what he does, listen to what he says, and then think ‚ÄòYeah, he seems like my kind of guy‚Äô is a matter of some confusion and no little distress to British people, given that:

‚Ä¢ Americans are supposed to be nicer than us, and mostly are.

‚Ä¢ You don‚Äôt need a particularly keen eye for detail to spot a few flaws in the man. 

This last point is what especially confuses and dismays British people, and many other people too; his faults seem pretty bloody hard to miss. After all, it‚Äôs impossible to read a single tweet, or hear him speak a sentence or two, without staring deep into the abyss. He turns being artless into an art form; he is a Picasso of pettiness; a Shakespeare of shit. His faults are fractal: even his flaws have flaws, and so on ad infinitum. God knows there have always been stupid people in the world, and plenty of nasty people too. But rarely has stupidity been so nasty, or nastiness so stupid. He makes Nixon look trustworthy and George W look smart. In fact, if Frankenstein decided to make a monster assembled entirely from human flaws ‚Äì he would make a Trump.

And a remorseful Doctor Frankenstein would clutch out big clumpfuls of hair and scream in anguish: ‚ÄòMy God‚Ä¶ what‚Ä¶ have‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ created?' If being a twat was a TV show, Trump would be the boxed set.‚Äù

CalltoActivism,2023-09-04 21:43:04+00:00,"A British writer penned the best description of Donald Trump I‚Äôve ever read:

‚ÄúWhy do some British people not like Donald Trump?‚Äù 

A few things spring to mind. Trump lacks certain qualities which the British traditionally esteem. For instance, he has no class, no charm, no coolness, no credibility, no compassion, no wit, no warmth, no wisdom, no subtlety, no sensitivity, no self-awareness, no humility, no honour and no grace ‚Äì all qualities, funnily enough, with which his predecessor Mr. Obama was generously blessed. So for us, the stark contrast does rather throw Trump‚Äôs limitations into embarrassingly sharp relief. 

Plus, we like a laugh. And while Trump may be laughable, he has never once said anything wry, witty or even faintly amusing ‚Äì not once, ever. I don‚Äôt say that rhetorically, I mean it quite literally: not once, not ever. And that fact is particularly disturbing to the British sensibility ‚Äì for us, to lack humour is almost inhuman. But with Trump, it‚Äôs a fact. He doesn‚Äôt even seem to understand what a joke is ‚Äì his idea of a joke is a crass comment, an illiterate insult, a casual act of cruelty. 

Trump is a troll. And like all trolls, he is never funny and he never laughs; he only crows or jeers. And scarily, he doesn‚Äôt just talk in crude, witless insults ‚Äì he actually thinks in them. His mind is a simple bot-like algorithm of petty prejudices and knee-jerk nastiness. 

There is never any under-layer of irony, complexity, nuance or depth. It‚Äôs all surface. Some Americans might see this as refreshingly upfront. Well, we don‚Äôt. We see it as having no inner world, no soul. And in Britain we traditionally side with David, not Goliath. All our heroes are plucky underdogs: Robin Hood, Dick Whittington, Oliver Twist. Trump is neither plucky, nor an underdog. He is the exact opposite of that. He‚Äôs not even a spoiled rich-boy, or a greedy fat-cat. He‚Äôs more a fat white slug. A Jabba the Hutt of privilege.

And worse, he is that most unforgivable of all things to the British: a bully. That is, except when he is among bullies; then he suddenly transforms into a snivelling sidekick instead. There are unspoken rules to this stuff ‚Äì the Queensberry rules of basic decency ‚Äì and he breaks them all. He punches downwards ‚Äì which a gentleman should, would, could never do ‚Äì and every blow he aims is below the belt. He particularly likes to kick the vulnerable or voiceless ‚Äì and he kicks them when they are down.

So the fact that a significant minority ‚Äì perhaps a third ‚Äì of Americans look at what he does, listen to what he says, and then think ‚ÄòYeah, he seems like my kind of guy‚Äô is a matter of some confusion and no little distress to British people, given that:

‚Ä¢ Americans are supposed to be nicer than us, and mostly are.

‚Ä¢ You don‚Äôt need a particularly keen eye for detail to spot a few flaws in the man. 

This last point is what especially confuses and dismays British people, and many other people too; his faults seem pretty bloody hard to miss. After all, it‚Äôs impossible to read a single tweet, or hear him speak a sentence or two, without staring deep into the abyss. He turns being artless into an art form; he is a Picasso of pettiness; a Shakespeare of shit. His faults are fractal: even his flaws have flaws, and so on ad infinitum. God knows there have always been stupid people in the world, and plenty of nasty people too. But rarely has stupidity been so nasty, or nastiness so stupid. He makes Nixon look trustworthy and George W look smart. In fact, if Frankenstein decided to make a monster assembled entirely from human flaws ‚Äì he would make a Trump.

And a remorseful Doctor Frankenstein would clutch out big clumpfuls of hair and scream in anguish: ‚ÄòMy God‚Ä¶ what‚Ä¶ have‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ created?' If being a twat was a TV show, Trump would be the boxed set.‚Äù

This is a result of the system. 

All the China programs in academia and think tanks only accept people who hate communism/socialism and have disdain for Chinese culture and people.

(Or, anything Chinese. If you show them a beautiful Chinese mountain, they will find faults with it).

Almost none of the ‚ÄúChina experts‚Äù can speak or write Chinese. (There are rare exceptions like Ezra Vogel, who has passed away)

Some may go to China and even get a degree from top-notch universities like  Tsinghua or Fudan. But they can do it without learning how to say, ‚ÄúNihao.‚Äù

Imperialists don‚Äôt learn the language of colonies. And all non-white countries are potential colonies.
