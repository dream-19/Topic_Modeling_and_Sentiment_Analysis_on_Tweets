She is incapable of winning, she is incapable of leading and she will cost us elections up and down the ballot in 2024. 

Ronna may be the longest serving chair in RNC history, but she is also going down as the most unsuccessful and corrupt Chair in the history of the Republican Party.

Republicans were decimated in 2018, she allowed Joe Biden to take the White House in 2020 and had the least successful midterm with a Democrat President in the history of the RNC. Now, she has corrupted and botched the debate process by attempting to hand-pick the 2024 GOP nominee with her elitist Washington D.C. buddies. This corruption and incompetence must come to an end or we will lose in 2024.

I encourage other Republicans to stand up and help the grassroots of the GOP take this Party back."
