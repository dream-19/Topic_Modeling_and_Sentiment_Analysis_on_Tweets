AmericaNewsroom,2023-06-26 17:03:58+00:00,"MAJORITY OF AMERICANS THINK UKRAINE VICTORY IS VITAL TO U.S. INTERESTS: SURVEY

A new survey from the @ReaganInstitute finds that three-quarters of Americans think it‚Äôs important to the U.S. that Ukraine wins the war against Russian aggression. That includes 86% of Democrats and 71% of Republicans. Nearly 60% support sending U.S. military aid to Ukraine, a figure that has held roughly steady since a November 2022 survey.

@marcthiessen with analysis: 

""What I think is so encouraging about this survey is that the support for Ukraine is so strong, despite the fact that nobody is making that case to them. That's the job of the Commander in Chief. When was the last time you saw Joe Biden give a major address? Not saying we'll support Ukraine no matter what it takes, as long as it takes, but saying here's why this is in America's national interest. Here's the consequences of success, the consequences of failure and why this benefits us to help them. He doesn't do it. And yet the American people strongly support Ukraine. Imagine if someone was making the case to them what the support would look like?""
