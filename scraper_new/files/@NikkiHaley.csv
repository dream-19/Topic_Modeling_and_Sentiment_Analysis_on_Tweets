21,NikkiHaley,2023-09-22 16:37:38+00:00,"Joe Biden thinks he’s protecting you from yourself. I trust you. I believe in you. 

A citizen of the United States is the most inspiring and impressive person in the world. You deserve the freedom to prove it once again. #TheFreedomPlan"

We will limit bureaucrats too.

No bureaucrat should hold the same position for more than five years."

They didn’t like it, but we did it anyway. It’s time to do the same in Washington. 

When I pick a fight, the people always win! #TheFreedomPlan"
26,NikkiHaley,2023-09-22 16:30:01+00:00,"If Congress fails to pass a budget, they will fail to get a paycheck. No budget, no pay – that’s a no-brainer. #TheFreedomPlan"

Congress will start from scratch every year, looking at what we have to have rather than what we’ve always spent. #TheFreedomPlan"

30,NikkiHaley,2023-09-22 16:28:21+00:00,"Let’s put in place a real limit on what Washington can spend. Federal spending should not rise to larger percentages of our economy. If a business kept spending more than it made, it would go broke. 

I refuse to let Congress spend America into bankruptcy. #TheFreedomPlan"
31,NikkiHaley,2023-09-22 16:27:39+00:00,I will veto any spending bill that doesn’t take us back to pre-COVID spending levels. #TheFreedomPlan
32,NikkiHaley,2023-09-22 16:26:52+00:00,Enough is enough. Politicians can’t spend their way to socialism if they don’t have the cash. We need to cut up the credit card – now. #TheFreedomPlan
33,NikkiHaley,2023-09-22 16:25:03+00:00,We should also eliminate Joe Biden’s $500 billion in green energy subsidies. No more cash windfalls for China. #TheFreedomPlan
34,NikkiHaley,2023-09-22 16:24:28+00:00,My tax cuts will put thousands of dollars in middle-class families’ pockets. #TheFreedomPlan
35,NikkiHaley,2023-09-22 16:24:13+00:00,"We’ll make the small business relief in the 2017 tax cuts permanent. It makes no sense that small businesses got temporary relief, while big businesses got permanent help. #TheFreedomPlan"
36,NikkiHaley,2023-09-22 16:23:40+00:00,We’ll cut income taxes for working families. The middle class should have fewer brackets and lower rates. #TheFreedomPlan
37,NikkiHaley,2023-09-22 16:23:08+00:00,We’ll completely eliminate the federal gas and diesel tax. #TheFreedomPlan
38,NikkiHaley,2023-09-22 16:22:44+00:00,My plan starts by giving real relief and financial freedom to middle class Americans. Every middle-class family will get thousands of dollars in tax relief. No one knows how to use your money better than you – no one. #TheFreedomPlan
39,NikkiHaley,2023-09-22 16:22:14+00:00,Americans are tired of working for Washington. It’s time for Washington to start working for us. That’s why I’m unveiling #TheFreedomPlan.
40,NikkiHaley,2023-09-22 16:21:09+00:00,Joe Biden is ultimately sending a message to every American: Don’t bother to dream; don’t bother to dare. Government’s got this. We became the greatest country the world has ever seen because we rejected that lie. #TheFreedomPlan
41,NikkiHaley,2023-09-22 16:20:58+00:00,"Whether it’s the big government right or the bigger government left, our leaders are insulting the American people. #TheFreedomPlan"
42,NikkiHaley,2023-09-22 16:20:49+00:00,Some Republicans want so-called “industrial policy” that bails out railroad unions or promotes the misnamed “stakeholder capitalism.”  That’s little more than socialism lite. Republicans used to know that giving DC more control isn’t the solution—it’s the problem. #TheFreedomPlan
43,NikkiHaley,2023-09-22 16:20:38+00:00,"Bidenomics is government control of everyone, from job creators to working families. #TheFreedomPlan"
44,NikkiHaley,2023-09-22 16:20:26+00:00,"As history shows, socialism kills the middle class. #TheFreedomPlan"
45,NikkiHaley,2023-09-22 16:20:18+00:00,"Joe Biden has created a political subsidy economy. The well-connected are getting wealthier through corporate welfare, while the poor get trapped in regular welfare. That’s called socialism. #TheFreedomPlan"
46,NikkiHaley,2023-09-22 16:20:07+00:00,"Look at the grossly misnamed Inflation Reduction Act. Biden’s signature “achievement” doled out hundreds of billions in blatant corporate welfare, while fueling inflation for everyone else. #TheFreedomPlan"
47,NikkiHaley,2023-09-22 16:19:54+00:00,"In two-and-a-half years, Joe Biden has done more damage than anyone thought possible. #TheFreedomPlan"
48,NikkiHaley,2023-09-22 16:19:47+00:00,"I’m running for President to save our country. We’ll end Joe Biden’s disastrous slide into socialism. We’ll unlock the power of American freedom. And we’ll move forward, together, into a future of prosperity and peace. #TheFreedomPlan"
49,NikkiHaley,2023-09-22 16:16:29+00:00,"Joe Biden is building the biggest government in American history. He’s swapping freedom for socialism. No one is happier than Communist China. 

Few things are more exciting for Xi Jinping than the prospect of four more years of Joe Biden. #TheFreedomPlan"

218,NikkiHaley,2023-09-11 14:01:43+00:00,"22 years ago, the soul of America was shaken in a way we had never felt before. Terrorists came into America and murdered thousands of our citizens on our soil. We will never forget the precious lives lost and the heroes who emerged—the firefighters who rushed into the towers, the airline passengers who gave their lives to save others, and so many who showed their courage on that terrible day.

Today, we have a new generation of young Americans who did not live through the horrors of 9/11. It’s our job to remind them that real evil exists in this world. The strength of America will prevail when we remember we are not immune from countries that want to destroy us.

In spite of the horrors of 9/11, what followed was the best of the American spirit. Americans rallied and united. Men and women, including my husband Michael, enlisted to defend our freedom and defeat evil. We saw a strong and proud America that refused to cower.

Some say our nation is too divided and will never come together like it did in the days following 9/11. I refuse to believe that. The American spirit is alive and well—we just need to tap into that spirit and remember how even on our worst day we are blessed to live in America."
