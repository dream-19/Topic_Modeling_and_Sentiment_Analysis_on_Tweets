NikkiHaley,2023-09-11 14:01:43+00:00,"22 years ago, the soul of America was shaken in a way we had never felt before. Terrorists came into America and murdered thousands of our citizens on our soil. We will never forget the precious lives lost and the heroes who emerged‚Äîthe firefighters who rushed into the towers, the airline passengers who gave their lives to save others, and so many who showed their courage on that terrible day.

Today, we have a new generation of young Americans who did not live through the horrors of 9/11. It‚Äôs our job to remind them that real evil exists in this world. The strength of America will prevail when we remember we are not immune from countries that want to destroy us.

In spite of the horrors of 9/11, what followed was the best of the American spirit. Americans rallied and united. Men and women, including my husband Michael, enlisted to defend our freedom and defeat evil. We saw a strong and proud America that refused to cower.

Some say our nation is too divided and will never come together like it did in the days following 9/11. I refuse to believe that. The American spirit is alive and well‚Äîwe just need to tap into that spirit and remember how even on our worst day we are blessed to live in America.",240.0

NikkiHaley,2023-08-15 14:48:47+00:00,"Two years ago, the world watched in horror as Joe Biden withdrew from Afghanistan in a way that betrayed our allies and emboldened our enemies. Disaster followed. 

Thirteen American service members were killed, China grew increasingly aggressive toward Taiwan, Russia invaded Ukraine, and terrorists took over Afghanistan with the help of American equipment and supplies. 

To date, no one has taken responsibility for the botched withdrawal. No one has been fired, and no one replaced. The families of the 13 murdered service members can‚Äôt even get basic answers about what happened. 

In a Haley administration, there will be no mistaking where we stand. Our allies will know we have their backs, and our enemies will fear American strength.",864.0
