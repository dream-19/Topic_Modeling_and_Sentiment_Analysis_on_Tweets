Our country should not be run like a business; it should be like a family. https://t.co/QQi7ZrBGZ4"

Corporate greed is a plague on our society. It acts at this point almost like a single institutionalized force, able to control our government  through its financial influence on Congress, the White House and SCOTUS.

Its tentacles reach into every sector of our society - poisoning our food and water and air; denying Americans health care; flooding our streets with guns; desecrating our environment; denying education and economic prospects to our young; and dominating our foreign affairs.

No, America, things are not okay. 

This is the 11th hour but it isn't midnight yet. Things can still be put right - but not by electing a status quo politician. 

The status quo will not disrupt itself.

It's time for the people to step in.

There's a reason why 75% of Americans support the strike; people on both Right and Left have begun to realize that the axis of opposition in this country isn't Right ver Left but rather Up versus Down. 

The profound income inequality now baked into the cake in this country is being rejected not by status quo politicians but by the American people. At a time of overarching economic injustice, there is a rising up of New Labor to push back against it.

Next step, elect a President who aligns with that 1,000 per cent.
