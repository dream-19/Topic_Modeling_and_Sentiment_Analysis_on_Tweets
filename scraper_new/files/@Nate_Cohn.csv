Nate_Cohn,2023-09-11 14:40:16+00:00,"All of this could easily change. But for now, the main upshot is that tied national polls today don't indicate a commanding Trump advantage in the battlegrounds, as I see so often assumed"
Nate_Cohn,2023-09-11 14:42:10+00:00,"And while there's no way to know whether this will last, there's also not much reason to assume Trump will sustain the overwhelming relative advantage in the E.C. he held in the last election, let alone that it will grow as many Dems feared"
Nate_Cohn,2023-09-07 14:18:25+00:00,"CNN/SSRS shows Trump+1, and the underlying story is much like the other polls: Biden hitting his targets among whites, matching the 43-44% of decided major party voters he won last time, but leading just 58-34 among nonwhite voters"

Nate_Cohn,2023-09-06 14:12:33+00:00,I've seen some haggling on twitter about whether Biden can 'really' be doing this poorly among nonwhite and especially Black voters. This might help make some more sense of some startling numbers  https://t.co/s6SgiD8VN6
Nate_Cohn,2023-09-06 14:18:59+00:00,"In Times/Siena polling specifically, the crosstabs for 2020 vote choice are illuminating for seeing these differences. Recalled vote isn't extremely reliable -- and we don't weight the 2020 universe -- but it does reveal the weirdness of comparing RVs to 'actual' voters https://t.co/iVeSlpP6lx"
Nate_Cohn,2023-09-06 14:24:30+00:00,"For all the squawking about tabs, notice that these particular ones do make some sense, even as the RV findings spark controversy. 72-7 among Black RVs in 2020 = 91-9 among those who voted and reported a preference; 39-22 among Hispanics is 64% for Biden, etc."

Nate_Cohn,2023-08-01 13:23:47+00:00,"To the extent the poll shows a tighter race than '24, it mainly seems to do so because of additional Trump gains among men, Black, Hispanic and low income/less educated voters.

Nate_Cohn,2023-07-31 21:26:46+00:00,"One interesting thing about this Times/Siena poll is that the full RV sample has really clean crosstabs, since it was constructed as two separate polls of GOP and non-GOP.

Nate_Cohn,2023-07-31 21:26:47+00:00,"I doubt this makes any real difference in the topline, but given how people love to scrutinize the crosstabs i might try out whether this kind of approach would holds up well when there are smaller sample sizes by party"
Nate_Cohn,2023-07-31 14:16:58+00:00,"One thing that caught my eye in the poll: Republicans thought DeSantis was more likable than Trump -- one of his few bright-spots in the poll-- despite all the dunking on him on this issue.

Nate_Cohn,2023-07-31 13:30:36+00:00,"From a methods standpoint, this could be the most complex Times/Siena poll we've done. The likely GOP electorate accounts for the primary rules of each state. And with separately weighted GOP and DEM/IND samples, the partisanship of each demographic is unusually representative"
Nate_Cohn,2023-07-31 13:33:03+00:00,"But despite all this, the poll is almost exactly aligned with the current polling average. Alternative definitions of the GOP universe -- say, all GOP+GOP leaning voters -- either yield essentially the same result or tend to modestly expand Trump's lead"
