The No Pay for Congress During Default or Shutdown Act, introduced by Reps. Abigail Spanberger (D-VA) and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA), would withhold lawmakers' pay for the duration of a debt limit breach or lapse in federal funding, an attempt to motivate legislators to prevent either situation. 

The bill comes amid growing fears that Republicans will not agree to meet the June 1 deadline set by the Treasury Department to raise the debt limit and risk a catastrophic default on U.S. obligations.

MeidasTouch,2023-09-26 08:08:16+00:00,"Donald Trump ignored the deadliest pandemic of our lifetimes.

He claimed it was a Democratic hoax. 

He said it would never come to our shores.

He knew it would be deadly; he even said it on recording while being interviewed for a book. 

Over a million died.

When Trump was president, refrigerated morgues had to park alongside hospitals to deal with the overflow of bodies.

Our family members, our friends, our neighbors ‚Äî gone in an instant.

We had to ration toilet paper.

We couldn‚Äôt find basic goods like water in our stores. 

In fact, nearly the entire country had to shut down.

Schools were closed. Funerals were missed. Our dreams were pushed off.

Republicans like to blame this on Democrats, but this all occurred under Donald Trump.

He failed in his most important duty as president: to protect Americans. 

And then he pitted Americans against each other to take the heat off his failure. He blamed the scientists. He blamed China.

He never once took responsibility.

He then virtually printed money and handed it out to the wealthiest people and corporations in America with the greatly abused PPP, which was ripe with fraud and corruption.

Meanwhile, the working class was destroyed.

Millions and millions lost their jobs.

Lines of cars wrapped for miles around local food banks.

Nurses and doctors were screamed at by individuals fueled by his hatred, and then mocked by those same people when they took a few minutes to post a TikTok to bring some levity into their grueling, sleepless days.

Life under Donald Trump was worse than a nightmare. It was hell on Earth.

I have a serious question for you.
How does shutting the government down ‚Äúhelp‚Äù you?
How does making the border less secure, air travel less sound & our food and drinking water less safe ‚Äúhelp‚Äù you?
How does forcing our active duty military, law enforcement & TSA officers to work without pay ‚Äúhelp‚Äù you?
If a hurricane were to level your town in two weeks, how does a depleted FEMA ‚Äúhelp‚Äù you?
If your rural community was finally about to get broadband, how does disrupting that ‚Äúhelp‚Äù you?
If you‚Äôre owed back pay by your employer, how does slowing that process down ‚Äúhelp‚Äù you?
How does undermining research on cancer & Alzheimer‚Äôs, delaying Road & bridge repairs, forcing nearly 7 million pregnant and postpartum women, infants, and children to go without food assistance or cutting off funding for the fledgling small businesses in your hometown ‚Äúhelp‚Äù you?
Cuz a bunch of the folks y‚Äôall sent to Congress to actually help you, think nothing of letting those things happen TO you (while they continue to get paid) unless they get what THEY want.
And what they want is to cut even more taxes for the rich, to take away that social security you‚Äôve been paying into & to protect one man.
So, my question remains‚Äî how does any of that help you?
And if they‚Äôre not in government to help you, why the hell are they there at all?",

In tonight‚Äôs deranged rant, Trump declared, ‚ÄúThey are almost all dishonest and corrupt, but Comcast, with its one-side and vicious coverage by NBC NEWS, and in particular MSNBC, often and correctly referred to as MSDNC (Democrat National Committee!), should be investigated for its ‚ÄúCountry Threatening Treason.‚Äù I say up front, openly, and proudly, that when I WIN the Presidency of the United States, they and others of the LameStream Media will be thoroughly scrutinized for their knowingly dishonest and corrupt coverage of people, things, and events. Why should NBC, or any other of the corrupt & dishonest media companies, be entitled to use the very valuable Airwaves of the USA, FREE? They are a true threat to Democracy and are, in fact, THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE! The Fake News Media should pay a big price for what they have done to our once great Country!

There you have it, folks. While Trump and his Republican enablers love to falsely accuse Democrats of ‚Äúweaponizing‚Äù the government against Trump, Trump himself is now openly threaten to weaponize the presidency to completely remove entire news channels from the airwaves simply because they expose his rampant criminality.

Vladimir Putin believes that democracy, democratic countries are weak, that it is a fragile system, he is sure that we will sooner or later get tired [of opposing him], that time is working for him.

But [the war in Ukraine] is as much a political battle as a military one. We have to show arguments in favor of democracy and freedom. Of course no one likes to pay more and more for electricity. But I believe that democracy educates people and they begin to understand the real reasons for what is happening.

The EU was a herbivore in a world of carnivores. The EU was in a stalemate. Ukraine gave us a boost.

‚ÄúSo whenever he accuses somebody else of doing something, it‚Äôs almost guaranteed he‚Äôs doing it himself or he‚Äôs already done it. Or whenever he denies¬†‚Äî¬†thinking about doing something or doing it, it‚Äôs almost guaranteed he is thinking about it or he‚Äôs already done it,‚Äù Clinton said, according to Psaki.

In her opinion article ahead of the interview at noon tomorrow, Psaki herself concluded with these words, ""It‚Äôs pretty clear Trump is a serial liar.¬†Just recently, the former president also lied about his engagement with impeachment, saying he isn‚Äôt involved¬†‚Äî¬†when we know that he has been talking frequently to the House members who are orchestrating it.

""Clinton‚Äôs insight is a reminder of how it is essential not to take Trump‚Äôs words at face value.¬†Because it may all just be projection.""

Note: Psaki has not said anything about the many lies of Joe Biden, or the lies by Hillary Clinton herself. As you can see, there is no objectivity in the mainstream media. It's all about agenda journalism.",4.0

1. Why do most Americans see a tax on the rich as a tax on them?

2. Why do #Democrats run in TERROR at being labeled a #LIBERAL? üòÆüò± But #Republicans embrace being called #Conservative?

ANSWER: 

1. #TrickleDownIdentity - the good of the rich is my good. And we Democrats don't confront this. We are no longer the party of FDR.

2. We delight in the ALIENATION of the middle class. Let's #BlueWave2024 with slogans -  ""We need a #WhitePrivilegeTax""! and  "" Real Immigrants that built America WADED THE RIVER and JUMPED the FENCE only a Fascist bigot would believe otherwise!""ü§î Oh sure we will win big time with that philosophy.

3. We CANNOT attack TRICKLE DOWN IDENTITY because to do so would attack our CORPORATE SPONSOR$. Instead let's be #GLOBALIZATION DENIERS for Hillary ü•≥üéâ

4. Welcome to #PronounNation.ü§î ""We are #woke and your children belong to us!"" Let's introduce GENDER DYSPHORIA ROLE MODELING to IMPRESSIONABLE kids. Then present PRONOUN IDENTITIES as SOLUTIONS to being bullied instead of attacking the bullying that comes FIRST.  

No Americans will not sacrifice their kids on the Altar of CLOSED MINDED WOKE. 

Open your eyes LIBERAL SWEDEN, LIBERAL Norway and LIBERAL Finland have reversed course on giving BIG PHARMA AFFIRMING hormones$ and child MUTILATION surgery. They stopped. #Texas did a SWEDEN.

Why?
BECAUSE SCIENCE MATTERS!
FACTS MATTER!
REALITY MATTERS. 

But the RIGHTEOUS WOKE close their eyes to science and shut down free speech. All for warm fuzzy feelings of RIGHTOUS WOKEFULLNESS. The new SECULAR ADAM üçé EVE COLLECTIVE RACE GUILT. I am #LiberalNotWoke 

QUESTION:
But Brian don't you feel GUILTY about slavery?
ANSWER:
I did not do it and my white skin doesn't make me any more guilty than the ole Religion of Adam üçé and Eve. We DO need to teach ALL of the HORROR of slavery. But not ALIENATE  today Whites as being personally guilty.....No you say?

üëâOk let's #BlueWave with slogans of a WHITE PRIVILEGE TAX ü•≥üéâüéâ. 

Look if you believe that then a White Privilege Tax is CONSISTENT with your values. Good luck with the election.  We need to look beyond TRIBAL LIES ON BOTH SIDE. TAP MEME BELOW ‚§µÔ∏è#LeaveOurKidsAlone #LGBWithoutTheT #NonBinaryPoliticallyFluidLIBERAL.",88.0

OccupyDemocrats,2023-09-22 23:17:41+00:00,"BREAKING: Democratic star Congressman Jamie Raskin predicts career doom for MAGA clowns Matt Gaetz and Marjorie Taylor Greene ‚Äî and exposes Gaetz‚Äôs shocking political plans for the future.

Pulling no punches, Raskin said that if the Republican civil war results in a government shutdown, Gaetz and Greene could be voted out faster than they realize.

Raskin also revealed that he believes Donald Trump is behind the current House disfunction. 

So far, Republicans have been unable to agree on a funding bill because the fascist wing is making insane demands of Speaker Kevin McCarthy.

‚ÄúDonald Trump is calling the shots across the board,‚Äù said Raskin in an MSNBC interview. ‚ÄúHe thinks he can shut down his indictments and the works of the special counsel and the Department of Justice and the federal courts by getting Matt Gaetz and Marjorie Taylor Greene and three other members of the ‚ÄòMAGA caucus‚Äô to derail the House and shut down the government of the United States.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs badly mistaken because the attorney general, Jack Smith, and the prosecutors are funded by a continuing, indefinite appropriation to the Department of Justice,‚Äù Raskin explained. 

Raskin then outlined how the plan will hurt Greene and Gaetz and dished on the latter‚Äôs ambitions for the future‚Äî

‚ÄúMarjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz ‚Äî who wants to run for governor of Florida, according to all the Republicans I serve with ‚Äî should figure out right now that they‚Äôre just going to end their political careers by shutting down the government for no reason,‚Äù said Raskin. ‚ÄúThey should tell Donald Trump that his plan isn‚Äôt going to work.‚Äù

Hopefully, Raskin is right and America soon sees the last of these two MAGA lunatics. 

The idea of Matt Gaetz ‚Äî a credibly accused child sex trafficker ‚Äî becoming the governor of one of the most powerful and populous states in the country is too horrifying to consider.

Please retweet and ‚ù§Ô∏è if you would never vote for Gaetz or Greene ‚Äî and consider joining the growing exodus to Tribel, a ‚Äúwoke‚Äù new Twitter competitor that is exploding in popularity because it banned Trump for life and because Elon Musk banned Tribel‚Äôs Twitter account ‚Äî but he forgot to ban this link to download the new Tribel app: https://t.co/HnJzSKjCwX",156.0

OccupyDemocrats,2023-09-23 20:49:14+00:00,"BREAKING: Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is hit with devastating news as the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library refuse to invite him to speak at next week‚Äôs high-profile debate event, call Trump a ‚Äúspoiled brat in a sandbox.‚Äù

But it gets even WORSE for Trump‚Ä¶ 

One member of the Reagan library‚Äôs board of trustees told Politico, ‚ÄúSo many of the things that Trump did, and what he stood for, are just not consistent with the Reagan philosophy. I wouldn‚Äôt want to condone what Trump had done by inviting him to speak. That would be sort of an acceptance of his behavior over the years.‚Äù

Even worse for Trump, next week‚Äôs debate will discuss ‚Äúthe future‚Äù of the Republican Party and ‚Äúthe issues, ideas and policies that will define the Republican Party for decades to come.‚Äù

Evidently, the board of the Reagan Library doesn‚Äôt see the serial criminal indicted on 91 charges as relevant to the party‚Äôs future ‚Äî a massive, humiliating slap in the face to Donald Trump and his campaign. 

Adding insult to injury for Trump, a top advisor to a member of the board tells Politico that Trump ‚Äúdrives‚Äù the Reagan Library board ‚Äúnuts‚Äù because ‚Äúthe legacy of Reagan, fair or unfair, right or wrong, was ‚Äòshining city on a hill‚Äô ‚Äî upbeat and positive and have a beer with Tip O‚ÄôNeill ‚Äî and Trump is Voldemort. He is the opposite. He wants to burn everything to the ground, attack people.‚Äù

That‚Äôs right. While Trumpers think that Trump is the second coming of their ‚ÄúSaint Ronnie,‚Äù the harsh reality is that the Reagan Library doesn‚Äôt even want to be associated him. 

Please retweet and ‚ù§Ô∏è to thank the Reagan Library for expose Trump ‚Äî and consider joining the growing exodus to Tribel, a woke new Twitter competitor that banned Trump for life and is exploding in popularity because Elon Musk banned Tribel‚Äôs Twitter account ‚Äî but he forgot to ban this link to download the new Tribel app: https://t.co/HnJzSKjCwX",270.0

#WhoFundsNoLabels 

Who does No Labels think they‚Äôre kidding with their secretive scam operation? 

No Labels wants to re-elect Donald trump.

Armed with $70 million in donations from dark money billionaires, No Labels is planning to run a third-party candidate to take away votes from Joe Biden and hand the 2024 election to Donald trump.

No Labels is a fraud trying to make folks believe they have a viable 3rd party ‚Äúcentrist‚Äù alternative candidate. 

No. Such. Thing. 

A third party candidate has NEVER and will NEVER win the presidency.  

No Labels own polling shows that there is no pathway for them to get the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. 

The real motive is to get the small number of votes needed in swing states to tip the electoral vote.

Putting trump ack in the White House would be catastrophic.

But-due to cruel and draconian GOP laws

She can‚Äôt get an abortion

That can‚Äôt happen in America-right?

But it does

And it will continue

Until we vote for change

OccupyDemocrats,2023-09-23 02:24:28+00:00,"BREAKING: Democratic star Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez brutally torches Fox News for ignoring the Lauren Boebert Beetlejuice sexual misconduct scandal.

‚ÄúAll I gotta say is I can‚Äôt go out to lunch in Florida in my free time, not doing anything, just eating outside and it‚Äôs wall-to-wall Fox News coverage,‚Äù said AOC in an Instagram video.

""And then you have a member of Congress engaging in sexually lewd acts in a public theater and they got nothing to say,"" she added.

To hammer home the hypocrisy of Fox, AOC compared their lack of Boebert coverage to their deranged coverage of a video of her dancing in college on a rooftop.

""I danced to Phoenix once in college and it was like all over the place. But them putting on a whole show of their own at ‚ÄòBeetlejuice‚Äô ‚Ä¶ and there‚Äôs nothin‚Äô?‚Äù she said. ""I‚Äôm just saying be consistent.""

AOC is absolutely right. Instead of covering Boebert's disgusting behavior, the Republican media bubble is fixated entirely on the Senate dress code right now, particularly John Fetterman's clothes. 

Conservatives are not serious people and cannot be trusted to govern.

Please retweet and ‚ù§Ô∏è if you think that AOC nailed it ‚Äî and consider joining the growing exodus to Tribel, a ‚Äúwoke‚Äù new Twitter competitor that is exploding in popularity because it banned Trump for life and because Elon Musk banned Tribel‚Äôs Twitter account ‚Äî but he forgot to ban this link to download the new Tribel app: https://t.co/HnJzSKjCwX",704.0

OccupyDemocrats,2023-09-21 22:25:12+00:00,"BREAKING: Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is asked directly to his face about the corrupt $2 billion ""investment"" that Saudi Arabia pumped into Jared Kushner's firm after Trump left office ‚Äî and his response is an absolute disaster.

The prince sat down for an interview with Fox News host Bret Baier asked him directly about the money, which was clearly payback for the huge favors Kushner did for the Saudis while he was in the White House.

Not only did the Trump administration give massive weapons deals to Saudi Arabia, they ignored the kingdom's brutal murder and dismemberment of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

""In the Trump administration, you had a really close relationship with the president's senior advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner,"" said Baier. ""After he left, Saudi fund made reportedly a two billion dollar investment in Jared's new fund he was launching and managing.""

""Do you think that sends the wrong message even if there wasn't a tit for tat, an 'I'll give you this and you get that'?"" asked Baier.

""We look to opportunities and investment,"" said bin Salman. ""We have a lot of investment around the globe with a lot of peoples and with economic opportunity.""

""So if Trump becomes president again you'll leave the two billion with Jared Kushner?"" asked Baier.

""It's a commitment that PIF [Public Investment Fund, the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia] have and when PIF have commitment with any investor around the globe, they keep it,"" said the prince.

In other words, if Donald Trump wins reelection the Saudis will be able to directly exploit the massive sum of money they gave to his son-in-law to influence American foreign policy ‚Äî even more than the already have.

""Would it affect your decisions with a new Trump administration with that sitting there?"" asked Baier.

""Well... Saudi Arabia is so big so I'm quite sure mostly any person around the world directly or indirectly you have something to do with Saudi Arabia,"" said bin Salman.

""So if that can affect President Trump's decision if he becomes a president that mean it can affect every president in the world and every person in the world's decision because directly or indirectly they have some sort of interest or something to do with Saudi Arabia,"" the prince added.

In other words, Saudi economic corruption is a powerful global force that affects more than just Donald Trump and Jared Kushner. 

Crucially, bin Salman did NOT deny the fact that he influences both men.

A vote for Donald Trump is a vote to give Saudi Arabia total control over the U.S. government and its military.

After the performance, Trump told Milley ‚ÄúWhy do you bring people like that here? No one wants to see that, the wounded,‚Äù and suggested Milley never let him appear in public again -- he said that within earshot of several witnesses.

That they're fighting funding 4 #Ukraine so hard means that #Putin is losing &amp; @TheJusticeDept &amp; #JackSmith is scaring them. Other nations r sending aid also.

MarioNawfal,2023-09-21 05:10:27+00:00,"BREAKING: BIDEN GRANTS LEGAL STATUS TO HALF A MILLION VENEZUELANS

The 470,000 illegal migrants will receive temporary legal status, granting them work permits and protection from being deported.

This news comes as NYC and Chicago have urged Biden to act. They no longer have the shelter capacity and are running low on funds to handle the influx of migrants.

The facilities at the border to hold the newcomers have also maxed out!

Over 2 million migrants crossed the border in 2022, and this number will be higher this year.

The Biden administration needs to take serious action to help the cities dealing with this crisis and manage the flow of migrants into the country.

Why is the current administration not taking decisive action?",1596.0

FeistyLibLady,2023-09-21 14:48:41+00:00,"It really is time for Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to delay the Senate's winter recess until all of the over 300 outstanding military confirmation hearings are held and approved.

No GOP Senator, especially dumb AF Tommy Tuberville, will want to give up their holiday recess to do this critical job needed for national security.

The GOP would finally tell Tommy to sit the fuck down and shut up.

The Senate needs to look at the draconian rules that control them.  One man should not have the power Tuberville has been given.  

Talking about draconian rules, the filibuster is one of the most draconian rules there is in the Senate.  It needs to go too.
