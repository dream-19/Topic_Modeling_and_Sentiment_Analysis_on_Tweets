OccupyDemocrats,2023-09-23 20:49:14+00:00,"BREAKING: Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is hit with devastating news as the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library refuse to invite him to speak at next week’s high-profile debate event, call Trump a “spoiled brat in a sandbox.”

But it gets even WORSE for Trump… 

One member of the Reagan library’s board of trustees told Politico, “So many of the things that Trump did, and what he stood for, are just not consistent with the Reagan philosophy. I wouldn’t want to condone what Trump had done by inviting him to speak. That would be sort of an acceptance of his behavior over the years.”

Even worse for Trump, next week’s debate will discuss “the future” of the Republican Party and “the issues, ideas and policies that will define the Republican Party for decades to come.”

Evidently, the board of the Reagan Library doesn’t see the serial criminal indicted on 91 charges as relevant to the party’s future — a massive, humiliating slap in the face to Donald Trump and his campaign. 

Adding insult to injury for Trump, a top advisor to a member of the board tells Politico that Trump “drives” the Reagan Library board “nuts” because “the legacy of Reagan, fair or unfair, right or wrong, was ‘shining city on a hill’ — upbeat and positive and have a beer with Tip O’Neill — and Trump is Voldemort. He is the opposite. He wants to burn everything to the ground, attack people.”

That’s right. While Trumpers think that Trump is the second coming of their “Saint Ronnie,” the harsh reality is that the Reagan Library doesn’t even want to be associated him. 

Please retweet and ❤️ to thank the Reagan Library for expose Trump — and consider joining the growing exodus to Tribel, a woke new Twitter competitor that banned Trump for life and is exploding in popularity because Elon Musk banned Tribel’s Twitter account — but he forgot to ban this link to download the new Tribel app: https://t.co/HnJzSKjCwX",

#WhoFundsNoLabels 

Who does No Labels think they’re kidding with their secretive scam operation? 

No Labels wants to re-elect Donald trump.

Armed with $70 million in donations from dark money billionaires, No Labels is planning to run a third-party candidate to take away votes from Joe Biden and hand the 2024 election to Donald trump.

No Labels is a fraud trying to make folks believe they have a viable 3rd party “centrist” alternative candidate. 

No. Such. Thing. 

A third party candidate has NEVER and will NEVER win the presidency.  

No Labels own polling shows that there is no pathway for them to get the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. 

The real motive is to get the small number of votes needed in swing states to tip the electoral vote.

Putting trump ack in the White House would be catastrophic.

OccupyDemocrats,2023-09-23 02:24:28+00:00,"BREAKING: Democratic star Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez brutally torches Fox News for ignoring the Lauren Boebert Beetlejuice sexual misconduct scandal.

“All I gotta say is I can’t go out to lunch in Florida in my free time, not doing anything, just eating outside and it’s wall-to-wall Fox News coverage,” said AOC in an Instagram video.

""And then you have a member of Congress engaging in sexually lewd acts in a public theater and they got nothing to say,"" she added.

To hammer home the hypocrisy of Fox, AOC compared their lack of Boebert coverage to their deranged coverage of a video of her dancing in college on a rooftop.

""I danced to Phoenix once in college and it was like all over the place. But them putting on a whole show of their own at ‘Beetlejuice’ … and there’s nothin’?” she said. ""I’m just saying be consistent.""

AOC is absolutely right. Instead of covering Boebert's disgusting behavior, the Republican media bubble is fixated entirely on the Senate dress code right now, particularly John Fetterman's clothes. 

Conservatives are not serious people and cannot be trusted to govern.

Please retweet and ❤️ if you think that AOC nailed it — and consider joining the growing exodus to Tribel, a “woke” new Twitter competitor that is exploding in popularity because it banned Trump for life and because Elon Musk banned Tribel’s Twitter account — but he forgot to ban this link to download the new Tribel app: https://t.co/HnJzSKjCwX",

OccupyDemocrats,2023-09-21 22:25:12+00:00,"BREAKING: Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is asked directly to his face about the corrupt $2 billion ""investment"" that Saudi Arabia pumped into Jared Kushner's firm after Trump left office — and his response is an absolute disaster.

The prince sat down for an interview with Fox News host Bret Baier asked him directly about the money, which was clearly payback for the huge favors Kushner did for the Saudis while he was in the White House.

Not only did the Trump administration give massive weapons deals to Saudi Arabia, they ignored the kingdom's brutal murder and dismemberment of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

""In the Trump administration, you had a really close relationship with the president's senior advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner,"" said Baier. ""After he left, Saudi fund made reportedly a two billion dollar investment in Jared's new fund he was launching and managing.""

""Do you think that sends the wrong message even if there wasn't a tit for tat, an 'I'll give you this and you get that'?"" asked Baier.

""We look to opportunities and investment,"" said bin Salman. ""We have a lot of investment around the globe with a lot of peoples and with economic opportunity.""

""So if Trump becomes president again you'll leave the two billion with Jared Kushner?"" asked Baier.

""It's a commitment that PIF [Public Investment Fund, the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia] have and when PIF have commitment with any investor around the globe, they keep it,"" said the prince.

In other words, if Donald Trump wins reelection the Saudis will be able to directly exploit the massive sum of money they gave to his son-in-law to influence American foreign policy — even more than the already have.

""Would it affect your decisions with a new Trump administration with that sitting there?"" asked Baier.

""Well... Saudi Arabia is so big so I'm quite sure mostly any person around the world directly or indirectly you have something to do with Saudi Arabia,"" said bin Salman.

""So if that can affect President Trump's decision if he becomes a president that mean it can affect every president in the world and every person in the world's decision because directly or indirectly they have some sort of interest or something to do with Saudi Arabia,"" the prince added.

In other words, Saudi economic corruption is a powerful global force that affects more than just Donald Trump and Jared Kushner. 

Crucially, bin Salman did NOT deny the fact that he influences both men.

A vote for Donald Trump is a vote to give Saudi Arabia total control over the U.S. government and its military.

Please retweet and ❤️ if you demand a full investigation into Jared Kushner — and consider joining the growing exodus to Tribel, a “woke” new Twitter competitor that is exploding in popularity because it banned Trump for life and because Elon Musk banned Tribel’s Twitter account — but he forgot to ban this link to download the new Tribel app: https://t.co/HnJzSKjCwX",352.0
