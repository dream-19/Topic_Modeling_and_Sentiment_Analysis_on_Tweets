These are the ‚Äúfamous‚Äù ones unafraid to let people know EXACTLY who they serve in DC.

There are 125 more whose names you will probably never know. People who fade into the background and keep being re-elected to serve only the Swamp while building personal wealth.

The ones who gain fame know their social media cult members will never truly challenge them and they‚Äôll continue to go on cable news to read the pre-approved scripts given to them by their puppet masters.

They also know that if they do a little political theater about the border, most will look the other way as they help the Swamp loot taxpayers and go against what most of their constituents want.

352,OccupyDemocrats,2023-09-21 22:25:12+00:00,"BREAKING: Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is asked directly to his face about the corrupt $2 billion ""investment"" that Saudi Arabia pumped into Jared Kushner's firm after Trump left office ‚Äî and his response is an absolute disaster.

The prince sat down for an interview with Fox News host Bret Baier asked him directly about the money, which was clearly payback for the huge favors Kushner did for the Saudis while he was in the White House.

Not only did the Trump administration give massive weapons deals to Saudi Arabia, they ignored the kingdom's brutal murder and dismemberment of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

""In the Trump administration, you had a really close relationship with the president's senior advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner,"" said Baier. ""After he left, Saudi fund made reportedly a two billion dollar investment in Jared's new fund he was launching and managing.""

""Do you think that sends the wrong message even if there wasn't a tit for tat, an 'I'll give you this and you get that'?"" asked Baier.

""We look to opportunities and investment,"" said bin Salman. ""We have a lot of investment around the globe with a lot of peoples and with economic opportunity.""

""So if Trump becomes president again you'll leave the two billion with Jared Kushner?"" asked Baier.

""It's a commitment that PIF [Public Investment Fund, the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia] have and when PIF have commitment with any investor around the globe, they keep it,"" said the prince.

In other words, if Donald Trump wins reelection the Saudis will be able to directly exploit the massive sum of money they gave to his son-in-law to influence American foreign policy ‚Äî even more than the already have.

""Would it affect your decisions with a new Trump administration with that sitting there?"" asked Baier.

""Well... Saudi Arabia is so big so I'm quite sure mostly any person around the world directly or indirectly you have something to do with Saudi Arabia,"" said bin Salman.

""So if that can affect President Trump's decision if he becomes a president that mean it can affect every president in the world and every person in the world's decision because directly or indirectly they have some sort of interest or something to do with Saudi Arabia,"" the prince added.

In other words, Saudi economic corruption is a powerful global force that affects more than just Donald Trump and Jared Kushner. 

Crucially, bin Salman did NOT deny the fact that he influences both men.

A vote for Donald Trump is a vote to give Saudi Arabia total control over the U.S. government and its military.
