14,NateSilver538,2023-09-15 07:05:31+00:00,"No other races were in play because it's California and no Republican has won a statewide race there since 2006. It's not a competitive state. For a D to *almost* lose the R candidate has to be good, sure. But also, the D candidate has to be quite poor."
15,stuartpstevens,2023-09-15 06:55:27+00:00,"In 2010, Ca. Republican party realized by July their only hope for state wide victory was in the AG race with the very popular LA DA. 

Jerry Brown was going to crush Meg Whitman. Newsom was never in doubt for Lt. Gov. No R. was going to beat Boxer. No other races were in play. 

As LA County DA, Cooley had been in office since 2010, received millions of votes vs. 100K for Harris as SF DA. Cooley outspent Harris. Candidate with largest base, more money, higher state wide name ID should have won against obscure SF DA. He lost."
16,NateSilver538,2023-09-15 07:08:25+00:00,"Harris also performed very poorly in the 2016 Democratic primary. And she consistently polls notably worse than Biden does against Trump. All of the evidence points in the same direction here.

+19.1
+15.0
+13.0 
+12.9

+0.8 (Harris)"
18,stuartpstevens,2023-09-15 05:46:58+00:00,"Fair question. Here's the answer: 

-@VP defeated an incumbent Democratic DA in SF. Started out third in three person race. Made runoff but trailed 33% to 37% against incumbent. Won with 56%.

-Ran for AG in Ca. against LA DA Steve Cooley, strongest Republican not named Schwarzenegger in twenty years. Cooley outspent Harris by almost a $1m. Very tight race. Took 3 weeks for winner to be declared. Harris won.

-Crushed Dem Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez in Senate race."

199,NateSilver538,2023-07-27 21:25:36+00:00,"They convinced themselves, under a lot of political pressure to find in favor of natural origin, that a natural origin was plausible (Andersen was initially skeptical that it was even plausible, saying a lab leak was ""so friggin' likely""). 

But they never unconvinced themselves that a lab leak was plausible, too. Even in the messages people cite as exculpatory (see example below), Andersen and other authors are very clear that a lab leak also remained plausible. (""It does not rule out lab passage"". ""None of this disproves accidental lab infection""). 

https://t.co/lE3LHSN1i5

Their initial draft of the paper was ""merely"" misleading, trying to privilege the natural origin hypothesis more than the authors privately believed, but leaving a little bit of daylight for lab leak. Nature Medicine asked them to remove that ambiguity and they did, to the point that the final paper unambiguously contradicted the private beliefs of at least some of the authors including the lead author (Andersen).

Andersen also said a lab leak was plausible in April, after the paper had been published."

486,NateSilver538,2023-05-09 07:07:31+00:00,AI will get better at targeted political communication and the general adjustment is probably to be more skeptical of content that flatters you too much. But people like being flattered and were probably too unskeptical of such content to begin with.
