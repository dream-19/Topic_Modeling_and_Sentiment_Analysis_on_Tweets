RepJimBanks,2021-04-04 19:13:30+00:00,.@GovChristie set the record straight this morning on Dem lies &amp; hypocrisy on Georgia election integrity measures ... worth watching entire interview. One great segment👇 https://t.co/ZCyc6NnLYC
GovChristie,2021-04-04 17:32:50+00:00,There are falsehoods being told by the White House about the Georgia voting law to stoke even more division in this country. It only took POTUS 84 days to break his promise to the American people to unite us. He is doing exactly what he regularly accused Donald Trump of doing.

GovChristie,2021-03-15 03:25:46+00:00,We need to stop the politicization of vaccines—it is making many Americans skeptical and refusing to be vaccinated. Just present facts—like that 95% of doctors offered the vaccine are taking it—and more Americans will be vaccinated &amp; herd immunity will come sooner.

GovChristie,2021-02-23 21:05:14+00:00,My last budget for NJ was $34.7b. Today’s proposal is $44.8b. 7.2% average spending increase per year. 29.1% over four years. And we borrowed $4.5b to support operating expenses and those bonds are not callable. Will cost taxpayers billions more. Elections do have consequences.
