BarackObama,2022-07-21 18:06:09+00:00,"There is so much power in telling our story, sharing our truth, and inviting others into our lives. I’m so proud of @MichelleObama for doing just that in her new book, The Light We Carry, and can’t wait for you to read it."
MichelleObama,2022-07-21 14:00:04+00:00,"These past few years, I've been thinking about how to stay centered in a world filled with so much uncertainty.

BarackObama,2022-07-18 18:31:15+00:00,"Ahead of Mandela Day, I spoke with the talented young people who just completed our @ObamaFoundation Leaders Africa program.

BarackObama,2022-07-17 17:45:09+00:00,"John Lewis and Reverend C.T. Vivian dedicated their lives to fighting for freedom and equality. They believed we could remake this country until it lived up to its full promise, and now it’s up to all of us to follow in their footsteps."
ObamaFoundation,2022-07-17 16:57:07+00:00,"Two years ago, the world lost Civil Rights icons Representative John Lewis &amp; Reverend C.T. Vivian.

BarackObama,2022-07-08 14:45:47+00:00,I am shocked and saddened by the assassination of my friend and longtime partner Shinzo Abe in Japan. Former Prime Minister Abe was devoted to both the country he served and the extraordinary alliance between the United States and Japan.
BarackObama,2022-07-08 14:45:47+00:00,"I will always remember the work we did to strengthen our alliance, the moving experience of traveling to Hiroshima and Pearl Harbor together, and the grace he and his wife Akie Abe showed to me and Michelle."

BarackObama,2022-07-05 00:16:47+00:00,Michelle and I mourn the passing of Clifford Alexander. He was an extraordinary public servant—who became the first African American Secretary of the Army—and an even better friend. We miss him already.
MichelleObama,2022-07-05 00:04:16+00:00,"These words were recited by Elizabeth Alexander at Barack’s inauguration in 2009—but they also describe how her father, Cliff Alexander, lived. https://t.co/Dj22BLvuYP"

And let's recommit to fighting for our democracy—there's still so much work to be done to perfect our union."
BarackObama,2022-06-30 23:14:41+00:00,"In 2016, I was proud to designate the Stonewall National Monument as the first national monument to tell the story of the struggle for LGBTQ+ rights."
BarackObama,2022-06-30 23:14:42+00:00,The Stonewall Uprising helped galvanize a movement for LGBTQ+ rights. The progress we’ve made in the years since is a testament to what happens when people organize and demand change. But we need to do more to safeguard LGBTQ+ rights and expand on those hard-earned victories.
BarackObama,2022-06-30 18:30:23+00:00,"No challenge poses a greater threat to our future than a changing climate. Every day, we’re feeling the impact of climate change, and today’s Supreme Court decision is a major step backward."
BarackObama,2022-06-30 18:30:24+00:00,The 6-3 decision strikes a blow to the EPA’s authority to regulate power plant emissions—paving the way to dismantle some of the most impactful provisions of the Clean Air Act and limit our ability to reduce carbon pollution.
BarackObama,2022-06-30 18:30:25+00:00,Climate change is no longer just about the future that we're trying to protect for our children or our grandchildren; it's about the reality we're living with now. That’s why it’s more urgent now than ever before that Congress pass @POTUS’ climate and clean energy investments.
BarackObama,2022-06-29 03:01:17+00:00,"As president, I saw Chancellor Merkel lead through crises with her wise pragmatism, good humor, and unrelenting moral compass—and I feel lucky to call her a friend.

BarackObama,2022-06-24 16:26:42+00:00,"Today, the Supreme Court not only reversed nearly 50 years of precedent, it relegated the most intensely personal decision someone can make to the whims of politicians and ideologues—attacking the essential freedoms of millions of Americans."
BarackObama,2022-06-24 16:26:43+00:00,"Across the country, states have already passed bills restricting choice. If you're looking for ways to respond, @PPFA, @USOWomen, and many other groups have been sounding the alarm on this issue for years—and will continue to be on the front lines of this fight. https://t.co/PpXBEcbL2S"
BarackObama,2022-06-24 16:26:44+00:00,"For more than a month, we’ve known this day was coming—but that doesn’t make it any less devastating. Here are my thoughts from when we first saw the draft ruling: https://t.co/aegHc7AoTm"
BarackObama,2022-06-24 04:45:35+00:00,"Progress isn’t always a straight line.
 
Today’s Supreme Court decision is wrong but Congress passing the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act is a modest but real step forward. And the fight will go on, thanks to the activists, survivors, and families who continue to demand action."
BarackObama,2022-06-23 23:32:39+00:00,"50 years ago, committed women and girls from around the country worked with Congress to pass Title IX and equal the playing field. @ESPN's 37 Words documentary looks into the impact of Title IX and the work still in front of us. https://t.co/PavwzUuTPg"
BarackObama,2022-06-22 23:01:20+00:00,Michelle and I started the @ObamaFoundation's Futures Series to connect the young leaders of tomorrow with the trailblazers of today. It’s great to see the impact that it’s already having on students from the South Side.
ObamaFoundation,2022-06-22 19:25:07+00:00,"We have a responsibility to the young people of the neighborhood. That's why we launched our Futures Series at Hyde Park Academy, the high school that neighbors the future Obama Presidential Center, to expose students to careers they may not have been envisioning for themselves. https://t.co/fyLYITWG7r"
BarackObama,2022-06-22 17:01:58+00:00,"Great news for parents: The COVID-19 vaccine is approved for kids under 5.

BarackObama,2021-11-18 19:02:53+00:00,"When it comes to climate change, we can’t afford to go backward—or even stay where we are. If we are going to act on the scale that’s required to combat this climate crisis, we all need to step up and meet this moment together."

BarackObama,2021-11-10 01:17:03+00:00,"I spoke at COP26 in Glasgow about what’s happened in the six years since the Paris Agreement, and how much further we still need to go to control climate change. https://t.co/an9xxwrOQC"
BarackObama,2021-11-10 01:17:03+00:00,"But once again, progress is partial. Most nations have failed to be as ambitious as they need to be, and the escalation of ambition that we anticipated in Paris six years ago has not been uniformly realized."
BarackObama,2021-11-10 01:17:04+00:00,"That’s why, if we’re going to act on the scale that’s required, climate change can’t be seen as another opportunity to score political points. We need everybody. And young people in particular have an opportunity to make a real difference."
BarackObama,2021-11-08 16:16:09+00:00,"We’ve done some important work since the Paris Agreement was signed six year ago, but we’re still nowhere near where we need to be on climate.

BarackObama,2021-10-29 18:00:11+00:00,"Signing the Paris Agreement to fight climate change was one of my proudest moments in office. But it was always a foundation to build on.

BarackObama,2021-10-05 21:01:09+00:00,"And in Georgia, Republicans released a congressional map that decreases the voting power of communities of color – including African Americans in a historically Black district – and ignores how the state has changed."
BarackObama,2021-10-05 21:01:10+00:00,"If we don’t stand up for democracy, we’ll see this type of gerrymandering happen in even more states. It’s why @DemRedistrict is fighting for #FairMaps. And it’s why the Senate must pass the Freedom to Vote Act to protect our communities from partisan gerrymandering."
BarackObama,2021-10-05 21:01:08+00:00,"Right now, state legislatures across the country are setting new boundaries for state legislative and congressional districts. And in many states, Republicans are drawing maps that allow them to hold onto power."
BarackObama,2021-10-05 21:01:09+00:00,"In Texas, for example, Republicans recently passed a law making voting harder, especially for people of color. Now they’re advancing a new congressional map that’s tilted in their favor and doesn’t reflect the state’s growth."
