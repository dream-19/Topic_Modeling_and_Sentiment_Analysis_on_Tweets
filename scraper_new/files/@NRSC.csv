Joe Biden‚Äôs VP staff colluded with Hunter‚Äôs business partner on Burisma corruption media response.

@RepJamesComer is calling on the National Archives to provide complete and unredacted documents related to the Office of the Vice President colluding with the Biden family and their business associates.

In one example, on December 4, 2015, Eric Schwerin, a longtime Biden family business associate, wrote to Kate Bedingfield in the Office of the Vice President, providing quotes the White House should use in response to media outreach regarding Hunter Biden‚Äôs role in Burisma.

Later that day, Ms. Bedingfield responded to Mr. Schwerin saying, ‚ÄúVP signed off on this[.]‚Äù

According to Devon Archer, after a Burisma board of directors meeting in Dubai on the evening of December 4, 2015, Hunter Biden ‚Äúcalled D.C.‚Äù to discuss pressure that Burisma asked him to relieve.

In the letter to the U.S. Archivist, Chairman Comer is requesting the documents and information below regarding communications between the Office of the Vice President and Hunter Biden or his business associates.

‚óæÔ∏è Complete and unredacted versions of all documents from Records on Hunter Biden, James Biden, and their Foreign Business Dealings, Case Number 2022-0121-F;
