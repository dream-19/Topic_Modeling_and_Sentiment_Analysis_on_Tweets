DavidSacks,2023-09-26 08:10:57+00:00,"SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER: A standing ovation for a Nazi exposes unpleasant truths about the war in Ukraine.

Western cheerleaders for the war in Ukraine have sought to deny the complicated relationship between Ukrainian nationalism and neo-Nazi groups [1], calling any discussion of a Nazi past or present in Ukraine a ‚ÄúPutin talking point.‚Äù But the truth can only be suppressed for so long, and it recently burst forth in what should have been a sleepy session of the Canadian Parliament.

In the midst of introducing Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky for yet another address to the House of Commons, Speaker Anthony Rota recognized 98-year-old Yaroslav Hunka as a Ukrainian war hero for fighting the Soviet Union during World War II [2], apparently unaware that Hunka had volunteered for the Waffen-SS Galicia division, a Nazi military unit notorious for horrific war crimes.[3] 

An entire roomful of MP‚Äôs, along with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and a fist-pumping Zelensky, rose in a standing ovation for Hunka.[4] Rota has effusively apologized for his mistake, but the embarrassing spectacle reveals some of the flaws in Western thinking about this war.

The Virtue-Signaling Imperative 

First, the incident shows how the virtue-signaling imperative to support Project Ukraine supersedes all other values and considerations. The logic works backwards as follows: Ukraine is good, therefore Ukrainian nationalism is good. If someone is a Ukrainian nationalist, therefore, they must be good. Inconvenient facts such as Junka‚Äôs service in the Waffen-SS or even that the father of Ukrainian nationalism, Stepan Bandera, was a Nazi collaborator[5], are mere historical details to be swept aside or airbrushed out, as Western media sometimes do to the photos of Ukrainian soldiers displaying Nazi symbols on their uniforms.[6]

Stripping away all of the present conflict‚Äôs historical context and complexity creates a simplistic binary: one must support either Ukrainian nationalism or the invader‚Äôs brute conquest. As this framing is reinforced over and over by the mainstream media and online partisans, any effort to seek a greater level of understanding becomes suspect. Do you have any deeper questions about the causes of the war or the potential paths to peace? You must be ‚Äúpro-Russian.‚Äù For most liberals, and certainly Canadian politicians, it is safer to indulge in historically ignorant virtue signaling than to risk being called a Putin apologist ‚Äì even if it results in the occasional moment of humiliation from cheering a Nazi.

Of course, the reality is more complicated than the simplistic binary. Most Ukrainian nationalists are not Nazis. But the presence of Nazi ideology in Ukraine is well documented,[7] and the most ardent ultra-nationalist groups in Ukraine retain the race ideology of their patriarch Bandera. This is why Nazi insignia often appear on Ukrainian uniforms.[8] This is why white nationalists flocked from all over Europe to fight on the Ukrainian side at the beginning of the war.[9] This is why some streets in Ukraine are named after Ukrainian Nazis who participated in war crimes.[10] This is why watchdog groups have been concerned about the rise of hate groups in Ukraine for some time.[11]

The Role of the Ultra-Nationalists

Despite all this, we have closed our eyes, covered our ears, and labeled Ukraine‚Äôs ‚ÄúNazi problem‚Äù a Putin talking point. This reveals a second and more disturbing flaw in the thinking of U.S. foreign policy: we have made common cause with the ultra-nationalists. Any sensible U.S. foreign policy towards Ukraine (assuming we saw a need to become involved at all) would have endeavored to keep these people at bay. Instead we cultivated them.

They participated in the U.S.-backed Maidan coup in 2014, and once a civil war broke out in reaction to the coup, far-right groups like Right Sector and the infamous Azov Battalion began killing separatists in the Donbas, running up a death toll of thousands. Instead of suppressing these efforts, the Kiev government incorporated these militias into the military command structure to continue their work.

The U.S. could have supported the Minsk Accords between 2015 and 2021 to peacefully resolve the conflict, but our policymakers were seduced by the idea that nationalist fervor in Ukraine would serve our interests. A Rand Corporation study showed how Ukraine could be used as a proxy to destabilize Russia.[12] Zbigniew Brzezinski‚Äôs Grand Chessboard explained that Ukraine was a hinge state; if it could be brought into the orbit of the West, Russia would no longer be a great power.[13] We therefore rationalized aligning with groups who would never compromise with Russia and turned a blind eye to their troubling politics.

A Tragic Refusal to Negotiate

As Zelensky has constantly reiterated, the Ukrainian position remains that every square inch of territory (including Crimea) must be returned to Ukraine or there will be no peace. But Moscow will never agree to this, particularly when it is winning a war of attrition. Now that the counteroffensive has failed to take back any meaningful amount of territory, there is no viable plan for evicting Russia from Ukrainian territory. The intransigence of Zelensky and his supporters in refusing to negotiate does not serve the long-term interests of Ukraine, which is presently being destroyed, but it is consistent with the agenda of the ultra-nationalists.

The tragedy is that in 2019 Zelensky was elected on a peace platform ‚Äì he was supposed to make peace with Russia under the auspices of Minsk II. But far-right groups threatened him with violence if he did, and he backed down.[14] By 2021 he had changed course and was supporting a resolution to take back Crimea and increasing the shelling of the Donbas. With an ardent Ukraine supporter (Biden) in the White House, and a new strategic agreement from the U.S. promising weapons, economic aid and future NATO membership, Zelensky was emboldened to pursue a hardline policy instead of the peace platform he was elected on. With both the U.S. and Ukraine‚Äôs far right aligned in favor of this position, it must have appeared suicidal to resist.

A Better U.S. Policy

A far better U.S. policy would have been to recognize the right of self-determination for all the people of Ukraine. But that would have meant acknowledging the loss of Crimea (which is mostly Russian) and granting regional autonomy to the Donbas as Ukraine agreed to do in Minsk II. Doing that, and taking NATO membership off the table, would have achieved peace and left Ukraine intact. But peace wasn‚Äôt the objective of State Department strategists, who wanted to weaken Russia and saw Ukraine as a pawn on their Grand Chessboard.

Giving a standing ovation to a former Nazi soldier is a moral stain, but sacrificing Ukraine in a geopolitical game while pretending to be its savior is a far greater one.

VivekGRamaswamy,2023-09-20 22:55:35+00:00,"Predictably, the likes of Jerry Nadler distorted my practical plan to shut down a corrupt agency during today‚Äôs Congressional hearing with Merrick Garland. Here‚Äôs the TRUTH: The FBI has a ~35,842 person staff. 56% of the bureau that are professional bureaucrats should be fired immediately. Just 44% of FBI employees are special agents & intelligence analysts‚Äîthese 15,770 specialists should be reassigned to serve under the narrow focus of other federal law enforcement agencies doing the same specialist work. This will not only root out corruption but also improve *effectiveness.*

Reassignments:

US Marshals Service (821 specialists/analysts transferred)
- Crimes against children

Department of Commerce
- Cyber crime > Bureau of Industry and Security (1860 specialists/analysts transferred)

Department of Defense
- Counter-intelligence > Defense Intelligence Agency (4,159 specialists/analysts transferred)

Kelly4Humanity,2023-09-17 20:05:33+00:00,"Earlier today, at a gas station, I witnessed a heartbreaking scene: a man, repeatedly having his cards declined while trying to buy gas. Glancing outside, I saw his family waiting in the car. Not to boast, but merely to illustrate the depth of the issue, I quietly covered some of his gas bill and left before he came back in.  

This isn't just about numbers or percentages; it's about real people facing tangible pain and stress. Americans are deeply feeling the pinch of inflation. The soaring costs of essentials like gas and groceries are more than just inconvenient; they're devastating for many families. Conservatives must address this pressing issue with urgency and compassion.

First, almost every Presidential candidate in the Republican Party has claimed to be a ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù. It‚Äôs as if this a required political status, rather than a deep and true commitment of the soul.

Next, saying you‚Äôre a ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean jack. Good grief @BillClinton, with his countless scandals, and Climate Cultist @algore were the first Southern Baptists to serve as President and VP. @BarackObama still fights for abortion up to birth, also claimed to be a Christian. And @JoeBiden has naked trans folks on the White House lawn who were they by his invitation, but he‚Äôs lifelong a Catholic. So there‚Äôs that.

Finally, Vivek shares my conservative political values, not only because of his Hindu faith, but because he is guided by love, optimism, and the idea that good should prevail. Whether Vivek‚Äôs being yelled at during a town hall or fiercely questioned by a far left reporter, video after video is proof of Vivek‚Äôs patience, willingness to value EVERYONE, and exemplifies the story of his fierce foundations in the truth.

Truth: The Reorganization Act of 1984 had a clear and full expiration date of its own (just like the Reorganization Act of 1977). During its effective period, it required Congress to affirmatively approve presidential reorganization plans by majority vote in both houses, but it expired years ago."

VivekGRamaswamy,2023-09-13 22:49:12+00:00,"Myth: The President of the United States does not have powers to reorganize or shut down federal agencies.

Truth: Key provisions of the Reorganization Act of 1977 (5 U.S.C. 901) still remain in effect: ‚ÄúThe President shall from time to time examine the organization of all agencies and shall determine what changes in such organization are necessary to carry out any policy set forth‚Äù in this statute, including but not limited to:

- ‚ÄúTo reduce expenditures and promote economy to the fullest extent consistent with the efficient operation of the Government""

- ‚ÄúTo reduce the number of agencies by consolidating those having similar functions under a single head, and to abolish such agencies or functions thereof as may not be necessary for the efficient conduct of the Government.‚Äù

The expired provisions of this statute are the ones that gave Congress the power to stop the President from acting‚Äîthe expiry of which arguably strengthens the President‚Äôs ability to use executive power to drive these changes under limited circumstances specified in the statute."

I remember to this day watching the heroism of the firefighters, police officers, and first responders who ran not from Ground Zero, but toward it, to help their fellow Americans in need. We honor those brave Americans today - and those who lost their lives as well as their families.

In the weeks that followed, we weren‚Äôt black or white; gay or straight; Democrat or Republican. We were all American. In the face of tragedy, we found unity. In the face of despair, we found renewed hope. Even as we pray that no calamity like it ever happens again, we can still long to be reunited once again as one nation under God.

Now 22 years later, we have a growing generation of young adults who weren‚Äôt yet born on that infamous day. We have an opportunity to ask how we commemorate our national identity on this day. We should celebrate our ability to gradually heal even our deepest wounds. We will forever continue to pursue our more perfect Union.

Our education system gets most of its work done at the local level & what we‚Äôll do with the former federal funds is support parents to access better schools that teach children instead of serving their union clients. A novel idea, I know.

mcuban,2023-09-10 00:59:51+00:00,"I'll play along @VivekGRamaswamy.

 80b will fund your UBI for school age parents program?  Let's do the math on a per child basis.  

There are about 75m kids 17 and under, and 25m 0 - 5 yrs old.  Do the parents of those kids under 5 get anything ?  I'll presume not 

So your 80b is allocated across 50m kids. That's 1600 per kid right?  Per Year.  Right $800 per semester ? 

How do you think that $1600  gets spent?

But wait there's more.  

Let's say parents are efficient buyers and schools go along with letting any child in. Do you think the best public schools will accept any child for $1600 ? Possibly over-flowing their schools? Requiring more local and state tax money to expand ?

 And,I'm guessing your biggest donors will have something to say about who goes to their kid's school. My NIMBY-dar is strong on this one. 

So let's pretend that parents and schools figure out some equilibrium and there are schools that will add the children for 1600.  

Who is going to pay for make those schools bigger ? Do you think $1600 per additional child will cover the capital and ongoing expenses  bill ?

How happy do you think taxpayers w no kids will be about that ?

But wait there is more...  at first glance giving $1600 to parents may sound great, but the reality is not every parent can take their kids to school across town. 

So now you have kids who can only go to the closest school with only 1600 per yr to contribute.  But those same schools may have really needed the funds that the DOE offered them .  That money is gone.  And they are now getting just $1600 per student. Think that covers what they lost ? If not, what happens to the kids that go to those schools ?

Do your economics advisors believe that the long term cost to American taxpayers for kids that go to underperforming schools increase or decrease state and  federal deficits ?

Just for clarification.

 I think there is unlimited room for improvement in how we handle education in this country.  I just think your approach is really dumb 

PS.  I did all this in about 30 minutes while watching the end of the Ole Miss Tulane game.  It's a great game"

VivekGRamaswamy,2023-09-07 19:29:36+00:00,"Having tried just about every trick in the book to eliminate President Trump from running in this election, the left is now deploying a new tactic to bar him from ever holding office again: the 14th Amendment. As someone who is now polling in second or third place in most major national polls, I would be able to more easily win this GOP primary if Trump were eliminated from competition, but that‚Äôs not how I want to succeed. I stand on principle over politics, which is why I am sharing the following viewpoint despite the fact that Trump is one of my opponents in this primary:

Section 3 of the 14th Amendment states that any person who has ‚Äúpreviously taken an oath ... as an officer of the United States ... to support the Constitution‚Äù is disqualified from holding public office if that person engaged ‚Äúin insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.‚Äù Politicized groups are attempting to make Trump ineligible to run for president, arguing he fomented and in fact engaged in insurrection on January 6. This is a perversion of the 14th Amendment.

The 14th Amendment was part of the ‚ÄúReconstruction Amendments‚Äù that were ratified following the Civil War. It was passed to prohibit former Confederate military and political leaders from holding high federal or state office. These men had clearly taken part in a rebellion against the United States: the Civil War. Participants in the events of January 6 did not. And Trump, of course, was not even among them. That makes it all the more absurd that a left-wing group in Colorado is asking a federal court to disqualify the former president on the same grounds, arguing that his stump speeches on and before January 6 equate to rebellion against the United States.

And there‚Äôs another legal problem: Trump is not a former ‚Äúofficer of the United States,‚Äù as that term is used in the Constitution, meaning Section 3 does not apply. As the Supreme Court explained in Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (2010), an ‚Äúofficer of the United States‚Äù is someone appointed by the president to aid him in his duties under Article II, Section 2. The term does not apply to elected officials, and certainly not to the president himself. The Framers of the 14th Amendment would be shocked and appalled to see their narrow provision‚Äîintended to bar former U.S officials who switched to the Confederacy from seeking public office‚Äîbeing weaponized by a sitting president and his political allies to prevent a former president from seeking reelection.

I‚Äôve said it before, and I‚Äôll say it again: President Biden and his allies are engaging in election interference of the highest order. Yesterday‚Äôs filing is just the latest in a string of baseless lawsuits designed to silence political opponents and swing the election for Joe Biden, this time by depriving Americans of the right to vote for their candidate of choice. The judge assigned to this case should immediately toss it out. Our country is becoming unrecognizable to anyone who understands our Constitution, and we don‚Äôt have long to fix it."

Our nation is being duped by a leader in Ukraine willing to sacrifice his own nation‚Äôs credibility as a ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù in a gambit to secure even more money from U.S. taxpayers. This is wrong.

Vladimir Putin has acted in a craven manner, but that shouldn‚Äôt trick the U.S. establishment into adopting the false narrative that Zelensky is a paragon of democratic leadership. He is not. In a span of just two years, Zelensky has made moves that bear a striking resemblance to the tactics employed by Vladimir Putin: Zelensky‚Äôs actions include the banning of 11 opposition parties and the consolidation of all state media into a single entity. These actions not only mirror Putin‚Äôs refusal to register opposition parties but also extensive government control over the media landscape.

We have more than fulfilled U.S. commitments to Ukraine in the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, even as we have badly violated James Baker‚Äôs February 1990 ‚ÄúNot One Inch‚Äù commitment to the Soviet Union‚Äôs then-President Mikhail Gorbachev about limiting NATO expansion.

We will be Uncle Sucker no more. With over $135 billion in funding already provided, Ukraine should easily be able to allocate 0.1 percent of that to pay for their election. Of course, the mainstream media and the establishment will say that any money the U.S. sends to support Ukraine is strictly ‚Äúitemized and audited‚Äù so that it can‚Äôt be used that way. This is a joke funnier than any Zelensky could have written in his prior career as a comedian. Don‚Äôt forget that in June, the Pentagon itself discovered an ‚Äúaccounting error‚Äù that artificially created an extra $6.2 billion for Ukraine without Congressional approval.

VivekGRamaswamy,2023-09-03 22:23:49+00:00,"Last week, Biden approved a military transfer of $80 million for Taiwan under the Foreign Military Financing (FMF), a program typically used for sovereign states. In response, China‚Äôs state-run newspaper has stated that the U.S. has crossed a red line with ‚Äúlethal consequences.‚Äù We are badly screwing up our posture & it doesn‚Äôt have to be this way. Right now the U.S. embraces the ‚ÄúOne China‚Äù Policy, which fails to recognize Taiwan as a nation & adopts ‚Äústrategic ambiguity‚Äù about whether or not the U.S. will defend Taiwan against invasion. This creates mutual confusion with China about red lines & increases the risk of major conflict between the U.S. and China, especially heightened in the near-term when the entire U.S. economy and modern way of life relies on leading-edge semiconductors manufactured in Taiwan.

It is a vital U.S. national security interest to ensure that China *does not* acquire sole control of the global semiconductor supply chain, so the U.S. should shift from strategic ambiguity to strategic clarity: commit to affirmatively *defend Taiwan against Chinese annexation until the U.S. achieves semiconductor independence*, at which point the U.S. should resume its current posture of strategic ambiguity.

In the meantime, Taiwan can double its own military expenditures to a more rational 4-5% of GDP while the U.S. bolsters its own military and economic alliances with India, Japan, and South Korea and fortifies our own homeland defense capabilities ‚Äì including but not limited to nuclear missile, super-EMP, and cyber defenses.

This is how we can stop Chinese aggression and advance vital long-run U.S. interests while avoiding World War III. I am the only U.S. Presidential candidate in either political party who has offered a clear vision for how to achieve this goal."

Languishing Establishment-Neocon campaigns need to raise $$, and they‚Äôre trying to serve up lies about my foreign policy to do it. Don‚Äôt buy it. Here‚Äôs the TRUTH. By the end of my first term, our relationship with Israel will be stronger than ever. I will consummate Abraham Accords 2.0 by the end of 2025, adding Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, and Indonesia to the pact. We will work with Israel to ensure that Iran *never* acquires a nuclear weapon that advances U.S. interests without putting U.S. lives on the line. The U.S. relationship with Israel exemplifies how our international relationships should work. It aligns with my vision to revive realism in our foreign policy: Israel spends a significant percentage of its GDP on defense than any major nation. 75% of the aid we provide to Israel must be spent in the U.S., and by 2028 the mandate is 100%. This is consistent with America-First foreign policy objectives.

As U.S. President, I will also learn from our friendship with Israel. I admire Israel‚Äôs strong border policies, tough-on-crime laws, strong national identity, and missile defense capabilities ‚Äì which should motivate us to act similarly here in the U.S.

Our aid to Israel will continue until the day when Israel tells the U.S. they‚Äôre ready for it to end. We‚Äôll use zero-base budgeting each year in all foreign aid.

VivekGRamaswamy,2023-08-30 01:58:33+00:00,"This evening, I am respectfully educating my colleagues and professional politicians in this race on existing U.S. Laws and how to reunite *all* Americans. I am offering a practical solution to address widespread concerns about U.S. election security that will help move the nation forward:
1. Make Election Day a National Holiday 
2. Single-Day Voting on Election Day 
3. Paper Ballots 
4. Government-issued photo ID matched to the voter file.

In an interview on NewsNation yesterday, Mr. @GovChristie criticized my proposal, calling me the ‚Äòworst of what politicians are characterized to be‚Äô and called me ‚Äòdangerous‚Ä¶Chat-GPT.‚Äô (I kinda like this one, Chris.) The Pence campaign also stated that my proposal reflected a ‚Äòshocking and concerning lack of understanding of how our system of government works.‚Äô

While these comments reflect desperation, and they are also dead wrong. It‚Äôs a shame that Establishment politicians require basic civics lessons from a political outsider, but here goes: 

Consistent with the 10th Amendment, I favor advancing Congressional legislation like the conservative American Confidence in Elections Act (ACE) to set national benchmarks, even as elections continue to be managed by the states as is primarily designated by Article I, Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution. 

For states that do not comply and use congressional authority over Washington D.C. as a laboratory for model election integrity legislation, he would also claw back already-distributed Help America Vote Act (HAVA) funding.

This proposal prevents U.S. elections from poisonous federal overreach but also delivers robust, permanent reform to ensure election integrity and the peaceful transition of power do not again come into direct conflict.

To Mr. Christie and Mr. Pence: you‚Äôre welcome. Please don‚Äôt make the law schools at Seton Hall and Indiana University cringe so badly for their alumni."

VivekGRamaswamy,2023-08-28 20:54:35+00:00,"Now that the Supreme Court finally ended affirmative action, colleges will only further deprioritize SAT scores in favor of subjective factors because of large racial disparities in test results. There‚Äôs a simple way forward that will drive excellence and diversity of talent among incoming college classes: the College Board should add a physical fitness section to the SAT, instead of just math and reading sections. This could mirror the ‚ÄúPresidential Fitness Test‚Äù ‚Äì consisting of a 1-mile run, pull-ups, sit-ups, shuttle run, etc. ‚Äì regularly administered across American high schools until the Obama White House disband it. This is a pro-merit solution that rewards diverse talents: it‚Äôs a fact that those who perform well on math & reading tests tend to perform more poorly on the 1-mile run, and vice versa. This would also help address a growing mental health crisis in our country: physical fitness correlates directly with lower rates of depression, anxiety, and drug use. This is not formally part of my Presidential platform but it‚Äôs a serious proposal to address multiple cultural & health challenges with a single actionable step: most solutions shouldn‚Äôt come top-down from government."

shellenberger,2023-08-15 18:58:38+00:00,"Facebook Censors Accurate Information Linking Wind Energy To Whale Deaths

Facebook also spreads misinformation by ""https://t.co/NuvsVDtvtc,"" which relies on debunked U.S. government sources

For the last 20 years, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that his social media company is the ‚Äúdigital equivalent of a town square,‚Äù committed to factual accuracy, and protecting the natural environment.

But now, Facebook is censoring accurate information about the relationship between industrial wind energy development and the increase in whale deaths off the East Coast.

Yesterday, Facebook and Instagram censored my post linking whale deaths to wind energy off the East Coast of the United States. The censorship came in the form of a ‚Äúhttps://t.co/IFNCMsQako‚Äù article from March 31, 2023, which relied entirely on U.S. government sources.

The censorship came on the exact same day that Public and Environmental Progress released a new documentary, ‚ÄúThrown To The Wind,‚Äù which proves that the https://t.co/IFNCMsQako article is false.

‚ÄúThrown To The Wind‚Äù presents powerful new scientific evidence that the wind industry is responsible for the increase in whale deaths and that U.S. government agencies are either covering up the evidence or have failed to do the research that is described in the film.

Facebook last year defended its censorship by saying its ‚Äúfact-checks‚Äù are just ‚Äúopinion‚Äù and thus immune from defamation lawsuits, like the one brought by former ABC News correspondent John Stossel.

But that means that Facebook is spreading disinformation. By ‚Äúdisinformation,‚Äù I mean information that the person knows to be false. Facebook knows its ‚Äúfact checks‚Äù are just their ‚Äúopinion.‚Äù Thus, labeling https://t.co/NuvsVDtvtc, which in this case is simply repeating US government misinformation, as a ‚Äúfact-checker‚Äù is disinformation.

And the consequences are serious. According to Facebook, ‚ÄúEach time a fact-checker rates a piece of content as false, Facebook significantly reduces the content‚Äôs distribution ‚Ä¶ We ‚Ä¶ apply a warning label that links to the fact-checker‚Äôs article, disproving the claim.‚Äù

Why is that? Why is Facebook censoring accurate information and spreading disinformation? And how can we fight back?"

Together, this is strictly bad for American greatness. Prior to the NRC‚Äôs inception, the average approval time for a new nuclear plant was 3-4 years. Today, it‚Äôs 25-40 years. By comparison, Japan is still able to build new plants in 3-4 years & it‚Äôs 5-8 years for France. Even worse, the cumbersome NRC regulatory burden ensures that the operating nuclear plants in the U.S. don‚Äôt use the newer Gen III or Gen IV models, which are safer and more efficient than the older Gen I and Gen II designs that the U.S. uses. By contrast, China is the first country to operate a Gen IV reactor while we‚Äôre still stuck in Gen II.

Answer: Shut down the NRC. I‚Äôll get the job done.

The NRC has a staff of ~2,949. 47% of the staff in administrative staff and redundant roles should be laid off immediately. 

The remaining 1,554 specialists will be reassigned to serve within other agencies that have overlapping missions for greater efficiency and better focus.

Reassignments:

- Department of Energy (1,176 specialists)
Office of Nuclear Energy: licensing, oversight, mission support, and training.

- The EPA (317 specialists)
Nuclear materials and waste safety.

- FEMA (43 specialists)
Event response

- DHS (18 specialists)

Adults are free to make whatever choices they want but do not foist that ideology onto children before children are in a position as adults to make decisions for themselves.

historyinmemes,2023-08-11 22:10:26+00:00,"On March 23, 1966, in an accident that is now known as the Palomares incident, a B-52 bomber carrying four hydrogen bombs collided with a refueling tanker in Spain, and one of its nuclear weapons dropped into the sea.

As a U.S. Navy salvage team worked to recover the bomb, the towing line broke, sending a heavy steel pipe shooting toward the team ‚Äî and in an incredible act of heroism, diver Carl Brashear threw himself in front of his men, taking the pipe in the leg.‚Å†

Brashear not only survived, but he overcame extraordinary obstacles to get himself recertified as a master diver even though his leg had been removed, making him the first amputee diver in Navy history. Brashear was motivated by his beliefs that ""It's not a sin to get knocked down; it's a sin to stay down"" and ""I ain't going to let nobody steal my dream.""

For his service in helping to retrieve the bomb, Brashear was later awarded the   Navy and Marine Corps Medal, the highest navy award for non-combat heroism."

VivekGRamaswamy,2023-08-11 20:28:33+00:00,It happened. Good. Now let‚Äôs see if it‚Äôs more than a fig leaf.
VivekGRamaswamy,2023-06-24 15:49:45+00:00,"It‚Äôs past time for the FBI and the DOJ to be fully transparent about these political investigations. Today, I am calling for a special counsel to investigate and publish all findings relating to Hunter Biden and Biden-family business dealings. We the People deserve to know.

I am deeply skeptical of special counsels. We should dispense with the charade that a ‚Äòspecial‚Äô counsel is somehow unbiased or immune from the Administrative State‚Äôs corruption. It‚Äôs a lose-lose proposition: either the special counsel still reports to the attorney general and is bound by DOJ rules and policies in which case it‚Äôs a farce, or else the special counsel is entirely unaccountable which creates an Inspector Javert dilemma. Neither is good.
¬†
But there cannot be a two-tiered justice system in this country. If there‚Äôs a Trump-focused special counsel, there *must* be a Biden-focused special counsel too - to investigate mounting evidence of Biden‚Äôs potential criminal violations. Public distrust of the American justice system is at an all-time high, and for good reason. For more than 10 years, there has been an FBI investigation into the alleged bribery of Hunter and Joe Biden from the Ukrainian executive of oligarch-owned Burisma. It‚Äôs shameful that we are only now hearing about it, and that Hunter Biden escaped DOJ scrutiny with a fig leaf of a settlement designed to provide air cover for the DOJ just days after it indicted the 45th President."
VivekGRamaswamy,2023-08-11 19:45:30+00:00,"On August 17, at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library in California, I will unveil my comprehensive foreign policy vision, including on Russia, China, Taiwan, India, and other Asian nations: shifting from ‚Äúliberal hegemony‚Äù to the Modern Monroe Doctrine. We will support freezing the current lines of control, reopening economic relations with Russia, & a hard commitment that NATO will not admit Ukraine in return for Russia exiting its military partnership with China, removing nuclear weapons from Kaliningrad, and ending its military presence in the Western Hemisphere ‚Äî a reverse maneuver of what Nixon accomplished with Mao in 1972.

We will further deter China from annexing Taiwan by shifting from strategic ambiguity to strategic clarity: we will defend until 2029 but not afterward, at which point we will have full semiconductor independence from Taiwan, significantly reduced economic independence on China, stronger relationships with India, Japan, and South Korea, and stronger U.S. homeland defense capabilities to protect against cyber, super-EMP, and nuclear attacks. In the meantime, we will have absolutely *zero* tolerance for any breaches of our homeland or aggression in the Western Hemisphere, including Chinese spy balloons, Chinese spy bases in Cuba, intentional fentanyl poisoning, biological lab leaks, illegal border crossings, or any other encroachments of the U.S. homeland ‚Äî and will make adversaries pay full-on hell if they do.

This is the way: I will lead our nation forward from ‚Äúneoconservatism‚Äù & ‚Äúliberal hegemony‚Äù toward a secure homeland that protects the tangible interests of its citizens."

VivekGRamaswamy,2023-08-11 15:39:58+00:00,"Shamefully @GovChristie and the rest of the bipartisan Establishment are spouting off more nonsense about Ukraine & goading @JoeBiden to sleepwalk us into potential nuclear war with Russia as he makes good on a family bribe. It doesn‚Äôt have to be this way. We can achieve peace: cease further U.S. support for Ukraine &¬† negotiate a peace treaty with Russia that achieves a vital U.S. security objective: stop Russia‚Äôs growing military alliance with China. This strategy is the mirror-image of President Nixon‚Äôs diplomatic maneuver that distanced China from Russia in 1972, except this time Putin is the new Mao. In 2001, Russia and China entered their¬†Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation and in February 2022 Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping announced a more expansive¬†‚Äúno-limits partnership.‚Äù¬†Collectively, these agreements effectively commit each country to defend the other militarily if either is attacked. The Sino-Russia alliance presents the greatest military risk the U.S. has ever faced. Russia and China together outmatch the U.S. in every area of great power competition: geographic footprint, economic potential, industrial manufacturing might, conventional military power, and¬†nuclear weapons, including¬†super-Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) weapons, which could destroy critical U.S. infrastructure resulting in hundreds of millions of American civilian casualties. My top U.S. national security objective is to disrupt this Sino-Russian alliance in a manner that weakens China without war."
