5,VivekGRamaswamy,2023-09-22 04:24:19+00:00,"You can’t just “reform” the administrative state. You need to *shut it down.* The U.S. President is empowered by Article II of the U.S. Constitution to do it. I will—starting with the head of the snake: the U.S. Department of Education. Here’s how.

Cut ~$8 billion in bureaucracy. The remaining $119 billion would be reassigned:

- $52 billion (41%) to states to improve educational quality with school choice.
- $61 billion (47.5%) to the Department of the Treasury to take care of outstanding student loans & grants, as an intermediate step to re-privatizing student loans by undoing the disastrous Obama-led damage.
- $6 billion (4.5%) to the Department of Labor for vocational rehabilitation and workforce education programs.
- Less than $500,000 (0.3%) to the National Council on Disability and Department of State for key programs."
6,VivekGRamaswamy,2023-09-22 03:37:39+00:00,"The climate disaster-related death rate is down by 98% over the last century, due to fossil fuels. 8x as many people die of cold temperatures as warm ones, and the best way to stop all temperature-related deaths right now is broader access to fossil fuels. China has 115 coal plants under construction now & another 250 planned while we’re shutting down the few we have left in America. These are inconvenient truths for the likes of the @GavinNewsom who wax eloquent about “science” without having the first clue about it.

8,VivekGRamaswamy,2023-09-22 03:00:30+00:00,"The bleak reality is our own U.S. military contractors depend on the *Chinese* supply chain to produce U.S. weapons, at a time when our own stockpiles are already bare. Every advanced weapon in the U.S. arsenal—from Tomahawk missiles to the F-35 fighter jet to Aegis-equipped destroyers and cruisers and everything in between is completely reliant on components made almost exclusively in China. During the Cold War, we weren’t dependent on our great rivals in the USSR for a single major component of our defense-industrial base. In this new Cold War, we are suicidally dependent on our chief adversary for our defense needs. Limiting excessive foreign engagement in non-strategic nations will allow the U.S. to reinvest in our domestic defense base without the need for expanding the overall U.S. military budget.

10,VivekGRamaswamy,2023-09-22 00:42:24+00:00,"TRUTH: a serious approach to declaring independence from the CCP requires not just onshoring production to the U.S., but *expanding* trade with our allies as well. China has both the world’s greatest reserves of rare earth minerals (40% of the world’s total) & also *imports* more rare earth minerals than any other country. The U.S. is low in rare earth minerals, *but* we are rich in allies with reserves. India and Brazil together hold around a quarter of the world’s rare earth reserves. We should invest & bring more of their minerals to the US for refinement. Chile, who is a US free trade partner, is home to the world’s 3rd greatest lithium reserves, which is essential to our batteries, yet our third-largest lithium partner is China. Meanwhile, Chile exports roughly 8X the lithium volume to China that the export to the U.S. This is senseless."

China exploited the bipartisan U.S. consensus around “democratic capitalism”’to achieve parity & co-dependence with the U.S. over the last 30 years, but now is the moment to fix it and regain American sovereignty:

1. Declare independence from the climate change agenda at home.
2. Achieve semiconductor independence from Taiwan.
3. Decouple the US defense-industrial base from China & commit to fortifying homeland defenses, with a minimum 4% of U.S. GDP on military spending through 2032
4. Diversify away from Chinese-controlled pharmaceutical supply chains - to reduce the risk of mass casualty in the future.

While many have been legit, many have also blatantly used the name of Jesus to benefit their campaigns and coffers. True.

Next, saying you’re a “Christian” doesn’t mean jack. Good grief @BillClinton, with his countless scandals, and Climate Cultist @algore were the first Southern Baptists to serve as President and VP. @BarackObama still fights for abortion up to birth, also claimed to be a Christian. And @JoeBiden has naked trans folks on the White House lawn who were they by his invitation, but he’s lifelong a Catholic. So there’s that.

Finally, Vivek shares my conservative political values, not only because of his Hindu faith, but because he is guided by love, optimism, and the idea that good should prevail. Whether Vivek’s being yelled at during a town hall or fiercely questioned by a far left reporter, video after video is proof of Vivek’s patience, willingness to value EVERYONE, and exemplifies the story of his fierce foundations in the truth. 

To my brothers and sisters in Jesus - Don’t be brainwashed by those who claim to be a “Christian” for what may only be political purposes. Don’t be coerced by their labels. The stakes are too high in this election, and we need Vivek as our 47th President. He’s the trusted-outsider, a conservative fighter, and not another career politician who checks a religious box.

I will appoint agency heads who will execute large “reductions in force.”

I remember to this day watching the heroism of the firefighters, police officers, and first responders who ran not from Ground Zero, but toward it, to help their fellow Americans in need. We honor those brave Americans today - and those who lost their lives as well as their families.

In the weeks that followed, we weren’t black or white; gay or straight; Democrat or Republican. We were all American. In the face of tragedy, we found unity. In the face of despair, we found renewed hope. Even as we pray that no calamity like it ever happens again, we can still long to be reunited once again as one nation under God.

Now 22 years later, we have a growing generation of young adults who weren’t yet born on that infamous day. We have an opportunity to ask how we commemorate our national identity on this day. We should celebrate our ability to gradually heal even our deepest wounds. We will forever continue to pursue our more perfect Union.

Their gambit is that the Establishment GOP’s blind allegiance to supporting Ukraine will outweigh the GOP’s fiscal discipline on wasteful domestic spending & win pork spending that the Democrats lost during the May debt ceiling talks.

Our education system gets most of its work done at the local level & what we’ll do with the former federal funds is support parents to access better schools that teach children instead of serving their union clients. A novel idea, I know.

Here’s the high-level plan. I’ll lay out details in D.C. on Wednesday at 11am. You’re welcome to join, I think you’d learn a lot. I love confronting thoughtful critics, and I think you’re better than someone who sloppily criticizes a plan he hasn’t heard."
283,mcuban,2023-09-10 00:59:51+00:00,"I'll play along @VivekGRamaswamy.

 80b will fund your UBI for school age parents program?  Let's do the math on a per child basis.  

There are about 75m kids 17 and under, and 25m 0 - 5 yrs old.  Do the parents of those kids under 5 get anything ?  I'll presume not 

So your 80b is allocated across 50m kids. That's 1600 per kid right?  Per Year.  Right $800 per semester ? 

How do you think that $1600  gets spent?

But wait there's more.  

Let's say parents are efficient buyers and schools go along with letting any child in. Do you think the best public schools will accept any child for $1600 ? Possibly over-flowing their schools? Requiring more local and state tax money to expand ?

 And,I'm guessing your biggest donors will have something to say about who goes to their kid's school. My NIMBY-dar is strong on this one. 

So let's pretend that parents and schools figure out some equilibrium and there are schools that will add the children for 1600.  

Who is going to pay for make those schools bigger ? Do you think $1600 per additional child will cover the capital and ongoing expenses  bill ?

How happy do you think taxpayers w no kids will be about that ?

But wait there is more...  at first glance giving $1600 to parents may sound great, but the reality is not every parent can take their kids to school across town. 

So now you have kids who can only go to the closest school with only 1600 per yr to contribute.  But those same schools may have really needed the funds that the DOE offered them .  That money is gone.  And they are now getting just $1600 per student. Think that covers what they lost ? If not, what happens to the kids that go to those schools ?

Do your economics advisors believe that the long term cost to American taxpayers for kids that go to underperforming schools increase or decrease state and  federal deficits ?

Just for clarification.

 I think there is unlimited room for improvement in how we handle education in this country.  I just think your approach is really dumb 

PS.  I did all this in about 30 minutes while watching the end of the Ole Miss Tulane game.  It's a great game"

341,VivekGRamaswamy,2023-09-07 19:29:36+00:00,"Having tried just about every trick in the book to eliminate President Trump from running in this election, the left is now deploying a new tactic to bar him from ever holding office again: the 14th Amendment. As someone who is now polling in second or third place in most major national polls, I would be able to more easily win this GOP primary if Trump were eliminated from competition, but that’s not how I want to succeed. I stand on principle over politics, which is why I am sharing the following viewpoint despite the fact that Trump is one of my opponents in this primary:

Section 3 of the 14th Amendment states that any person who has “previously taken an oath ... as an officer of the United States ... to support the Constitution” is disqualified from holding public office if that person engaged “in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.” Politicized groups are attempting to make Trump ineligible to run for president, arguing he fomented and in fact engaged in insurrection on January 6. This is a perversion of the 14th Amendment.

The 14th Amendment was part of the “Reconstruction Amendments” that were ratified following the Civil War. It was passed to prohibit former Confederate military and political leaders from holding high federal or state office. These men had clearly taken part in a rebellion against the United States: the Civil War. Participants in the events of January 6 did not. And Trump, of course, was not even among them. That makes it all the more absurd that a left-wing group in Colorado is asking a federal court to disqualify the former president on the same grounds, arguing that his stump speeches on and before January 6 equate to rebellion against the United States.

And there’s another legal problem: Trump is not a former “officer of the United States,” as that term is used in the Constitution, meaning Section 3 does not apply. As the Supreme Court explained in Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (2010), an “officer of the United States” is someone appointed by the president to aid him in his duties under Article II, Section 2. The term does not apply to elected officials, and certainly not to the president himself. The Framers of the 14th Amendment would be shocked and appalled to see their narrow provision—intended to bar former U.S officials who switched to the Confederacy from seeking public office—being weaponized by a sitting president and his political allies to prevent a former president from seeking reelection.

I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: President Biden and his allies are engaging in election interference of the highest order. Yesterday’s filing is just the latest in a string of baseless lawsuits designed to silence political opponents and swing the election for Joe Biden, this time by depriving Americans of the right to vote for their candidate of choice. The judge assigned to this case should immediately toss it out. Our country is becoming unrecognizable to anyone who understands our Constitution, and we don’t have long to fix it."

Our nation is being duped by a leader in Ukraine willing to sacrifice his own nation’s credibility as a “democracy” in a gambit to secure even more money from U.S. taxpayers. This is wrong.

Vladimir Putin has acted in a craven manner, but that shouldn’t trick the U.S. establishment into adopting the false narrative that Zelensky is a paragon of democratic leadership. He is not. In a span of just two years, Zelensky has made moves that bear a striking resemblance to the tactics employed by Vladimir Putin: Zelensky’s actions include the banning of 11 opposition parties and the consolidation of all state media into a single entity. These actions not only mirror Putin’s refusal to register opposition parties but also extensive government control over the media landscape.

We have more than fulfilled U.S. commitments to Ukraine in the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, even as we have badly violated James Baker’s February 1990 “Not One Inch” commitment to the Soviet Union’s then-President Mikhail Gorbachev about limiting NATO expansion.

We will be Uncle Sucker no more. With over $135 billion in funding already provided, Ukraine should easily be able to allocate 0.1 percent of that to pay for their election. Of course, the mainstream media and the establishment will say that any money the U.S. sends to support Ukraine is strictly “itemized and audited” so that it can’t be used that way. This is a joke funnier than any Zelensky could have written in his prior career as a comedian. Don’t forget that in June, the Pentagon itself discovered an “accounting error” that artificially created an extra $6.2 billion for Ukraine without Congressional approval. The notion that all money and military equipment being sent to Ukraine is being carefully tracked is deeply dishonest. Americans deserve the TRUTH."

We don't want any brown faces that don't want to be a brown voice. And so yes, I do think that there are echoes of a historical ugly racism in this country now showing up in new clothing, and what I want to lead us to as the next president is a united nation where we don't actually judge each other on the color of our skin."""

404,VivekGRamaswamy,2023-09-03 22:23:49+00:00,"Last week, Biden approved a military transfer of $80 million for Taiwan under the Foreign Military Financing (FMF), a program typically used for sovereign states. In response, China’s state-run newspaper has stated that the U.S. has crossed a red line with “lethal consequences.” We are badly screwing up our posture & it doesn’t have to be this way. Right now the U.S. embraces the “One China” Policy, which fails to recognize Taiwan as a nation & adopts “strategic ambiguity” about whether or not the U.S. will defend Taiwan against invasion. This creates mutual confusion with China about red lines & increases the risk of major conflict between the U.S. and China, especially heightened in the near-term when the entire U.S. economy and modern way of life relies on leading-edge semiconductors manufactured in Taiwan.

It is a vital U.S. national security interest to ensure that China *does not* acquire sole control of the global semiconductor supply chain, so the U.S. should shift from strategic ambiguity to strategic clarity: commit to affirmatively *defend Taiwan against Chinese annexation until the U.S. achieves semiconductor independence*, at which point the U.S. should resume its current posture of strategic ambiguity.

In the meantime, Taiwan can double its own military expenditures to a more rational 4-5% of GDP while the U.S. bolsters its own military and economic alliances with India, Japan, and South Korea and fortifies our own homeland defense capabilities – including but not limited to nuclear missile, super-EMP, and cyber defenses.

This is how we can stop Chinese aggression and advance vital long-run U.S. interests while avoiding World War III. I am the only U.S. Presidential candidate in either political party who has offered a clear vision for how to achieve this goal."
