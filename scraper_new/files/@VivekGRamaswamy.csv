You need to *shut it down.* The U.S. President is empowered by Article II of the U.S. Constitution to do it. I will‚Äîstarting with the head of the snake: the U.S. Department of Education. Here‚Äôs how.

Cut ~$8 billion in bureaucracy. The remaining $119 billion would be reassigned:

- $52 billion (41%) to states to improve educational quality with school choice.
- $61 billion (47.5%) to the Department of the Treasury to take care of outstanding student loans & grants, as an intermediate step to re-privatizing student loans by undoing the disastrous Obama-led damage.
- $6 billion (4.5%) to the Department of Labor for vocational rehabilitation and workforce education programs.

Every advanced weapon in the U.S. arsenal‚Äîfrom Tomahawk missiles to the F-35 fighter jet to Aegis-equipped destroyers and cruisers and everything in between is completely reliant on components made almost exclusively in China. During the Cold War, we weren‚Äôt dependent on our great rivals in the USSR for a single major component of our defense-industrial base. In this new Cold War, we are suicidally dependent on our chief adversary for our defense needs.

3. Improve homeland security: nuclear missile, super EMP, cyber & space defense capabilities

Last month I described exactly *how* we will realistically avoid World War III at the Nixon Presidential Library. On Sept. 21 at 11 AM in my home state of Ohio, I will describe with unprecedented specificity *how* we will declare economic independence from an adversary that powers our modern way of life, from the phones in our pockets to the shoes on our feet. Through near-shoring to the U.S. and diversifying Chinese supply chains to our allies instead (South Korea, Japan, India, others), we can strengthen U.S. security while also improving economic prosperity for all Americans. https://t.co/1WoLvXfgjI"

The power to prescribe the ‚Äúreduction in force‚Äù rules governing the ‚Äúreductions in force‚Äù rest with the Office Personnel Management (OPM), and the current OPM rules give the power to effect ‚Äúreductions in force‚Äù to agency heads. I will appoint agency heads who will execute large ‚Äúreductions in force.‚Äù

If agency heads do not cooperate, 5 U.S. Code ¬ß 3302 empowers the President to override the OPM rules and drive the reductions in force directly. Note that the U.S. President is not an agency and thus not covered by the Administrative Procedures Act."

283,mcuban,2023-09-10 00:59:51+00:00,"I'll play along @VivekGRamaswamy.

 80b will fund your UBI for school age parents program?  Let's do the math on a per child basis.  

There are about 75m kids 17 and under, and 25m 0 - 5 yrs old.  Do the parents of those kids under 5 get anything ?  I'll presume not 

So your 80b is allocated across 50m kids. That's 1600 per kid right?  Per Year.  Right $800 per semester ? 

How do you think that $1600  gets spent?

But wait there's more.  

Let's say parents are efficient buyers and schools go along with letting any child in. Do you think the best public schools will accept any child for $1600 ? Possibly over-flowing their schools? Requiring more local and state tax money to expand ?

 And,I'm guessing your biggest donors will have something to say about who goes to their kid's school. My NIMBY-dar is strong on this one. 

So let's pretend that parents and schools figure out some equilibrium and there are schools that will add the children for 1600.  

Who is going to pay for make those schools bigger ? Do you think $1600 per additional child will cover the capital and ongoing expenses  bill ?

How happy do you think taxpayers w no kids will be about that ?

But wait there is more...  at first glance giving $1600 to parents may sound great, but the reality is not every parent can take their kids to school across town. 

So now you have kids who can only go to the closest school with only 1600 per yr to contribute.  But those same schools may have really needed the funds that the DOE offered them .  That money is gone.  And they are now getting just $1600 per student. Think that covers what they lost ? If not, what happens to the kids that go to those schools ?

Do your economics advisors believe that the long term cost to American taxpayers for kids that go to underperforming schools increase or decrease state and  federal deficits ?

Just for clarification.

 I think there is unlimited room for improvement in how we handle education in this country.  I just think your approach is really dumb 

PS.  I did all this in about 30 minutes while watching the end of the Ole Miss Tulane game.  It's a great game"

341,VivekGRamaswamy,2023-09-07 19:29:36+00:00,"Having tried just about every trick in the book to eliminate President Trump from running in this election, the left is now deploying a new tactic to bar him from ever holding office again: the 14th Amendment. As someone who is now polling in second or third place in most major national polls, I would be able to more easily win this GOP primary if Trump were eliminated from competition, but that‚Äôs not how I want to succeed. I stand on principle over politics, which is why I am sharing the following viewpoint despite the fact that Trump is one of my opponents in this primary:

Section 3 of the 14th Amendment states that any person who has ‚Äúpreviously taken an oath ... as an officer of the United States ... to support the Constitution‚Äù is disqualified from holding public office if that person engaged ‚Äúin insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.‚Äù Politicized groups are attempting to make Trump ineligible to run for president, arguing he fomented and in fact engaged in insurrection on January 6. This is a perversion of the 14th Amendment.

The 14th Amendment was part of the ‚ÄúReconstruction Amendments‚Äù that were ratified following the Civil War. It was passed to prohibit former Confederate military and political leaders from holding high federal or state office. These men had clearly taken part in a rebellion against the United States: the Civil War. Participants in the events of January 6 did not. And Trump, of course, was not even among them. That makes it all the more absurd that a left-wing group in Colorado is asking a federal court to disqualify the former president on the same grounds, arguing that his stump speeches on and before January 6 equate to rebellion against the United States.

And there‚Äôs another legal problem: Trump is not a former ‚Äúofficer of the United States,‚Äù as that term is used in the Constitution, meaning Section 3 does not apply. As the Supreme Court explained in Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (2010), an ‚Äúofficer of the United States‚Äù is someone appointed by the president to aid him in his duties under Article II, Section 2. The term does not apply to elected officials, and certainly not to the president himself. The Framers of the 14th Amendment would be shocked and appalled to see their narrow provision‚Äîintended to bar former U.S officials who switched to the Confederacy from seeking public office‚Äîbeing weaponized by a sitting president and his political allies to prevent a former president from seeking reelection.

I‚Äôve said it before, and I‚Äôll say it again: President Biden and his allies are engaging in election interference of the highest order. Yesterday‚Äôs filing is just the latest in a string of baseless lawsuits designed to silence political opponents and swing the election for Joe Biden, this time by depriving Americans of the right to vote for their candidate of choice. The judge assigned to this case should immediately toss it out. Our country is becoming unrecognizable to anyone who understands our Constitution, and we don‚Äôt have long to fix it."

Our nation is being duped by a leader in Ukraine willing to sacrifice his own nation‚Äôs credibility as a ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù in a gambit to secure even more money from U.S. taxpayers. This is wrong.

Vladimir Putin has acted in a craven manner, but that shouldn‚Äôt trick the U.S. establishment into adopting the false narrative that Zelensky is a paragon of democratic leadership. He is not. In a span of just two years, Zelensky has made moves that bear a striking resemblance to the tactics employed by Vladimir Putin: Zelensky‚Äôs actions include the banning of 11 opposition parties and the consolidation of all state media into a single entity. These actions not only mirror Putin‚Äôs refusal to register opposition parties but also extensive government control over the media landscape.

We have more than fulfilled U.S. commitments to Ukraine in the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, even as we have badly violated James Baker‚Äôs February 1990 ‚ÄúNot One Inch‚Äù commitment to the Soviet Union‚Äôs then-President Mikhail Gorbachev about limiting NATO expansion.

We will be Uncle Sucker no more. With over $135 billion in funding already provided, Ukraine should easily be able to allocate 0.1 percent of that to pay for their election. Of course, the mainstream media and the establishment will say that any money the U.S. sends to support Ukraine is strictly ‚Äúitemized and audited‚Äù so that it can‚Äôt be used that way. This is a joke funnier than any Zelensky could have written in his prior career as a comedian. Don‚Äôt forget that in June, the Pentagon itself discovered an ‚Äúaccounting error‚Äù that artificially created an extra $6.2 billion for Ukraine without Congressional approval.

Here‚Äôs the TRUTH: the real problem in our country isn‚Äôt the fact that global temperatures are going up slightly (they are), but the toxic anti-carbon agenda we‚Äôve adopted in response. Today, 8x as many people die of cold temperatures as warm ones & the right answer to all temperature-related deaths is *greater* access to fossil fuels. The climate disaster-related death rate is down by 98% in the last century & Earth is more covered with green surface area today because carbon is plant food. The same people who rail against carbon emissions in the U.S. are fine with shifting them to China while also opposing nuclear energy in the U.S. So yes, the *climate agenda is a hoax.* It‚Äôs a shame we have Republican swamp creatures trying to dupe our own people, which makes us less effective in fighting back against the climate cult.

404,VivekGRamaswamy,2023-09-03 22:23:49+00:00,"Last week, Biden approved a military transfer of $80 million for Taiwan under the Foreign Military Financing (FMF), a program typically used for sovereign states. In response, China‚Äôs state-run newspaper has stated that the U.S. has crossed a red line with ‚Äúlethal consequences.‚Äù We are badly screwing up our posture & it doesn‚Äôt have to be this way. Right now the U.S. embraces the ‚ÄúOne China‚Äù Policy, which fails to recognize Taiwan as a nation & adopts ‚Äústrategic ambiguity‚Äù about whether or not the U.S. will defend Taiwan against invasion. This creates mutual confusion with China about red lines & increases the risk of major conflict between the U.S. and China, especially heightened in the near-term when the entire U.S. economy and modern way of life relies on leading-edge semiconductors manufactured in Taiwan.

It is a vital U.S. national security interest to ensure that China *does not* acquire sole control of the global semiconductor supply chain, so the U.S. should shift from strategic ambiguity to strategic clarity: commit to affirmatively *defend Taiwan against Chinese annexation until the U.S. achieves semiconductor independence*, at which point the U.S. should resume its current posture of strategic ambiguity.

In the meantime, Taiwan can double its own military expenditures to a more rational 4-5% of GDP while the U.S. bolsters its own military and economic alliances with India, Japan, and South Korea and fortifies our own homeland defense capabilities ‚Äì including but not limited to nuclear missile, super-EMP, and cyber defenses.

This is how we can stop Chinese aggression and advance vital long-run U.S. interests while avoiding World War III. I am the only U.S. Presidential candidate in either political party who has offered a clear vision for how to achieve this goal."
