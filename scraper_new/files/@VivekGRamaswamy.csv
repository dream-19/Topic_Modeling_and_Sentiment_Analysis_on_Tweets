Heath Robinson, a Navy SEAL Senior Chief, heroically rescued a fallen teammate during a 2010 nighttime raid against a heavily armed Taliban commander. Without hesitation, Heath engaged the enemy and provided critical covering fire while his teammates moved their mortally wounded companion to safety, earning a Bronze Star for his valor—a true hero.

Tragically, 17 months later, on August 6, 2011, Heath was killed in action when his helicopter was shot down over Afghanistan. Today, he rests in Section 60 at Arlington National Cemetery. I have the utmost respect & admiration for our nation’s Gold Star families, for the ultimate sacrifices they have made in service to our country. They represent the very best of our great nation.

As President, I will take seriously the responsibility of commanding our armed forces and take care of our veterans and their families. I will *never* send our sons & daughters to die in no-win wars that don’t advance our interests. National defense will be about *defending* the homeland. That will be our top priority. 🇺🇸"

Cut ~$8 billion in bureaucracy. The remaining $119 billion would be reassigned:

- $52 billion (41%) to states to improve educational quality with school choice.
- $61 billion (47.5%) to the Department of the Treasury to take care of outstanding student loans & grants, as an intermediate step to re-privatizing student loans by undoing the disastrous Obama-led damage.

I want to say something about Biden and why I don't talk much about him on the campaign trail. I don't even think he's the one that is running the country. I think he is a puppet for the managerial class in the administrative state...

1. Avoid World War III

Last month I described exactly *how* we will realistically avoid World War III at the Nixon Presidential Library. On Sept. 21 in my home state of Ohio, I will describe with unprecedented specificity *how* we will declare economic independence from an adversary that powers our modern way of life, from the phones in our pockets to the shoes on our feet. Through near-shoring to the U.S. and diversifying Chinese supply chains to our allies instead (South Korea, Japan, India, others), we can strengthen U.S. security while also improving economic prosperity for all Americans."

Truth: Key provisions of the Reorganization Act of 1977 (5 U.S.C. 901) still remain in effect: “The President shall from time to time examine the organization of all agencies and shall determine what changes in such organization are necessary to carry out any policy set forth” in this statute, including but not limited to:

- “To reduce expenditures and promote economy to the fullest extent consistent with the efficient operation of the Government""

- “To reduce the number of agencies by consolidating those having similar functions under a single head, and to abolish such agencies or functions thereof as may not be necessary for the efficient conduct of the Government.”

The expired provisions of this statute are the ones that gave Congress the power to stop the President from acting—the expiry of which arguably strengthens the President’s ability to use executive power to drive these changes under limited circumstances specified in the statute."

Truth: “Reductions in force” are not covered by for-cause requirements. 5 U.S. Code § 3502 expressly states that “reductions in force” are subject only to 60-day notice requirements and order-of-retention rules. The power to prescribe the “reduction in force” rules governing the “reductions in force” rest with the Office Personnel Management (OPM), and the current OPM rules give the power to effect “reductions in force” to agency heads. I will appoint agency heads who will execute large “reductions in force.”

If agency heads do not cooperate, 5 U.S. Code § 3302 empowers the President to override the OPM rules and drive the reductions in force directly. Note that the U.S. President is not an agency and thus not covered by the Administrative Procedures Act."

We honor those brave Americans today - and those who lost their lives as well as their families.

In the weeks that followed, we weren’t black or white; gay or straight; Democrat or Republican. We were all American. In the face of tragedy, we found unity. In the face of despair, we found renewed hope. Even as we pray that no calamity like it ever happens again, we can still long to be reunited once again as one nation under God.

Now 22 years later, we have a growing generation of young adults who weren’t yet born on that infamous day. We have an opportunity to ask how we commemorate our national identity on this day. We should celebrate our ability to gradually heal even our deepest wounds. We will forever continue to pursue our more perfect Union.

Our education system gets most of its work done at the local level & what we’ll do with the former federal funds is support parents to access better schools that teach children instead of serving their union clients. A novel idea, I know.

321,mcuban,2023-09-10 00:59:51+00:00,"I'll play along @VivekGRamaswamy.

 80b will fund your UBI for school age parents program?  Let's do the math on a per child basis.  

There are about 75m kids 17 and under, and 25m 0 - 5 yrs old.  Do the parents of those kids under 5 get anything ?  I'll presume not 

So your 80b is allocated across 50m kids. That's 1600 per kid right?  Per Year.  Right $800 per semester ? 

How do you think that $1600  gets spent?

But wait there's more.  

Let's say parents are efficient buyers and schools go along with letting any child in. Do you think the best public schools will accept any child for $1600 ? Possibly over-flowing their schools? Requiring more local and state tax money to expand ?

 And,I'm guessing your biggest donors will have something to say about who goes to their kid's school. My NIMBY-dar is strong on this one. 

So let's pretend that parents and schools figure out some equilibrium and there are schools that will add the children for 1600.  

Who is going to pay for make those schools bigger ? Do you think $1600 per additional child will cover the capital and ongoing expenses  bill ?

How happy do you think taxpayers w no kids will be about that ?

But wait there is more...  at first glance giving $1600 to parents may sound great, but the reality is not every parent can take their kids to school across town. 

So now you have kids who can only go to the closest school with only 1600 per yr to contribute.  But those same schools may have really needed the funds that the DOE offered them .  That money is gone.  And they are now getting just $1600 per student. Think that covers what they lost ? If not, what happens to the kids that go to those schools ?

Do your economics advisors believe that the long term cost to American taxpayers for kids that go to underperforming schools increase or decrease state and  federal deficits ?

Just for clarification.

 I think there is unlimited room for improvement in how we handle education in this country.  I just think your approach is really dumb 

PS.  I did all this in about 30 minutes while watching the end of the Ole Miss Tulane game.  It's a great game"

378,VivekGRamaswamy,2023-09-07 19:29:36+00:00,"Having tried just about every trick in the book to eliminate President Trump from running in this election, the left is now deploying a new tactic to bar him from ever holding office again: the 14th Amendment. As someone who is now polling in second or third place in most major national polls, I would be able to more easily win this GOP primary if Trump were eliminated from competition, but that’s not how I want to succeed. I stand on principle over politics, which is why I am sharing the following viewpoint despite the fact that Trump is one of my opponents in this primary:

Section 3 of the 14th Amendment states that any person who has “previously taken an oath ... as an officer of the United States ... to support the Constitution” is disqualified from holding public office if that person engaged “in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.” Politicized groups are attempting to make Trump ineligible to run for president, arguing he fomented and in fact engaged in insurrection on January 6. This is a perversion of the 14th Amendment.

The 14th Amendment was part of the “Reconstruction Amendments” that were ratified following the Civil War. It was passed to prohibit former Confederate military and political leaders from holding high federal or state office. These men had clearly taken part in a rebellion against the United States: the Civil War. Participants in the events of January 6 did not. And Trump, of course, was not even among them. That makes it all the more absurd that a left-wing group in Colorado is asking a federal court to disqualify the former president on the same grounds, arguing that his stump speeches on and before January 6 equate to rebellion against the United States.

And there’s another legal problem: Trump is not a former “officer of the United States,” as that term is used in the Constitution, meaning Section 3 does not apply. As the Supreme Court explained in Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (2010), an “officer of the United States” is someone appointed by the president to aid him in his duties under Article II, Section 2. The term does not apply to elected officials, and certainly not to the president himself. The Framers of the 14th Amendment would be shocked and appalled to see their narrow provision—intended to bar former U.S officials who switched to the Confederacy from seeking public office—being weaponized by a sitting president and his political allies to prevent a former president from seeking reelection.

I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: President Biden and his allies are engaging in election interference of the highest order. Yesterday’s filing is just the latest in a string of baseless lawsuits designed to silence political opponents and swing the election for Joe Biden, this time by depriving Americans of the right to vote for their candidate of choice. The judge assigned to this case should immediately toss it out. Our country is becoming unrecognizable to anyone who understands our Constitution, and we don’t have long to fix it."

Our nation is being duped by a leader in Ukraine willing to sacrifice his own nation’s credibility as a “democracy” in a gambit to secure even more money from U.S. taxpayers. This is wrong.

Vladimir Putin has acted in a craven manner, but that shouldn’t trick the U.S. establishment into adopting the false narrative that Zelensky is a paragon of democratic leadership. He is not. In a span of just two years, Zelensky has made moves that bear a striking resemblance to the tactics employed by Vladimir Putin: Zelensky’s actions include the banning of 11 opposition parties and the consolidation of all state media into a single entity. These actions not only mirror Putin’s refusal to register opposition parties but also extensive government control over the media landscape.

We have more than fulfilled U.S. commitments to Ukraine in the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, even as we have badly violated James Baker’s February 1990 “Not One Inch” commitment to the Soviet Union’s then-President Mikhail Gorbachev about limiting NATO expansion.

We will be Uncle Sucker no more. With over $135 billion in funding already provided, Ukraine should easily be able to allocate 0.1 percent of that to pay for their election. Of course, the mainstream media and the establishment will say that any money the U.S. sends to support Ukraine is strictly “itemized and audited” so that it can’t be used that way. This is a joke funnier than any Zelensky could have written in his prior career as a comedian. Don’t forget that in June, the Pentagon itself discovered an “accounting error” that artificially created an extra $6.2 billion for Ukraine without Congressional approval. The notion that all money and military equipment being sent to Ukraine is being carefully tracked is deeply dishonest. Americans deserve the TRUTH."

Today, 8x as many people die of cold temperatures as warm ones & the right answer to all temperature-related deaths is *greater* access to fossil fuels. The climate disaster-related death rate is down by 98% in the last century & Earth is more covered with green surface area today because carbon is plant food.

441,VivekGRamaswamy,2023-09-03 22:23:49+00:00,"Last week, Biden approved a military transfer of $80 million for Taiwan under the Foreign Military Financing (FMF), a program typically used for sovereign states. In response, China’s state-run newspaper has stated that the U.S. has crossed a red line with “lethal consequences.” We are badly screwing up our posture & it doesn’t have to be this way. Right now the U.S. embraces the “One China” Policy, which fails to recognize Taiwan as a nation & adopts “strategic ambiguity” about whether or not the U.S. will defend Taiwan against invasion. This creates mutual confusion with China about red lines & increases the risk of major conflict between the U.S. and China, especially heightened in the near-term when the entire U.S. economy and modern way of life relies on leading-edge semiconductors manufactured in Taiwan.

It is a vital U.S. national security interest to ensure that China *does not* acquire sole control of the global semiconductor supply chain, so the U.S. should shift from strategic ambiguity to strategic clarity: commit to affirmatively *defend Taiwan against Chinese annexation until the U.S. achieves semiconductor independence*, at which point the U.S. should resume its current posture of strategic ambiguity.

In the meantime, Taiwan can double its own military expenditures to a more rational 4-5% of GDP while the U.S. bolsters its own military and economic alliances with India, Japan, and South Korea and fortifies our own homeland defense capabilities – including but not limited to nuclear missile, super-EMP, and cyber defenses.

This is how we can stop Chinese aggression and advance vital long-run U.S. interests while avoiding World War III. I am the only U.S. Presidential candidate in either political party who has offered a clear vision for how to achieve this goal."

1. FFs power warning and evac systems.
2. Drought, not storm, deaths are the leading source of climate death reduced.

Doing just a bit of logical thinking makes it obvious that fossil fuels are totally vital to the increase in safety from storm—not just because of powering storm warning system and evacuation systems, but also powering all the machines that make our infrastructure far sturdier than it used to be.

And if you're going to claim, against all logic, that storm warning systems prevented all the climate disaster deaths—not considering fossil-fueled irrigation, crop transport, heating, air-conditioning, etc etc—WHY NOT LOOK AT THE ACTUAL DATA? @nytimes, @PolitiFact, just totally repeat a bizarre and provably false claim with no fact-checking!

This time U.S. taxpayers are footing the bill for a personal bribe, and even worse our nation is marching closer to major conflict with a nuclear superpower as a consequence.

Languishing Establishment-Neocon campaigns need to raise $$, and they’re trying to serve up lies about my foreign policy to do it. Don’t buy it. Here’s the TRUTH. By the end of my first term, our relationship with Israel will be stronger than ever. I will consummate Abraham Accords 2.0 by the end of 2025, adding Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, and Indonesia to the pact. We will work with Israel to ensure that Iran *never* acquires a nuclear weapon that advances U.S. interests without putting U.S. lives on the line. The U.S. relationship with Israel exemplifies how our international relationships should work. It aligns with my vision to revive realism in our foreign policy: Israel spends a significant percentage of its GDP on defense than any major nation. 75% of the aid we provide to Israel must be spent in the U.S., and by 2028 the mandate is 100%. This is consistent with America-First foreign policy objectives.

As U.S. President, I will also learn from our friendship with Israel. I admire Israel’s strong border policies, tough-on-crime laws, strong national identity, and missile defense capabilities – which should motivate us to act similarly here in the U.S.

Our aid to Israel will continue until the day when Israel tells the U.S. they’re ready for it to end. We’ll use zero-base budgeting each year in all foreign aid.

In so doing the SEC didn’t follow the “basic principle that similar cases should be treated similarly.” Encouraging to see how other branches of government, here the judiciary, are serving as important checks and balances to agencies.

The U.S. currently doesn’t even recognize Taiwan as a nation. Democrats and Republicans both unquestioningly endorse the “one China” policy and embrace “strategic ambiguity” toward the island. No other presidential candidate is willing to commit to militarily defending Taiwan, and in December 2016 President Trump was roundly derided for violating diplomatic protocol for the high offense of answering a congratulatory phone call from Taiwan’s president.

By contrast, I favor strategic clarity: Defend Taiwan vigorously until the U.S. achieves semiconductor independence, then resume the posture of strategic ambiguity when the stakes are lower for the U.S. The American way of life depends on leading-edge semiconductors manufactured in Taiwan, and we can’t risk China gaining near-total leverage over the entire U.S. economy."

578,VivekGRamaswamy,2023-08-30 01:58:33+00:00,"This evening, I am respectfully educating my colleagues and professional politicians in this race on existing U.S. Laws and how to reunite *all* Americans. I am offering a practical solution to address widespread concerns about U.S. election security that will help move the nation forward:
1. Make Election Day a National Holiday 
2. Single-Day Voting on Election Day 
3. Paper Ballots 
4. Government-issued photo ID matched to the voter file.

In an interview on NewsNation yesterday, Mr. @GovChristie criticized my proposal, calling me the ‘worst of what politicians are characterized to be’ and called me ‘dangerous…Chat-GPT.’ (I kinda like this one, Chris.) The Pence campaign also stated that my proposal reflected a ‘shocking and concerning lack of understanding of how our system of government works.’

While these comments reflect desperation, and they are also dead wrong. It’s a shame that Establishment politicians require basic civics lessons from a political outsider, but here goes: 

Consistent with the 10th Amendment, I favor advancing Congressional legislation like the conservative American Confidence in Elections Act (ACE) to set national benchmarks, even as elections continue to be managed by the states as is primarily designated by Article I, Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution. 

For states that do not comply and use congressional authority over Washington D.C. as a laboratory for model election integrity legislation, he would also claw back already-distributed Help America Vote Act (HAVA) funding.

This proposal prevents U.S. elections from poisonous federal overreach but also delivers robust, permanent reform to ensure election integrity and the peaceful transition of power do not again come into direct conflict.

To Mr. Christie and Mr. Pence: you’re welcome. Please don’t make the law schools at Seton Hall and Indiana University cringe so badly for their alumni."

By contrast, I favor strategic clarity: Defend Taiwan vigorously until the U.S. achieves semiconductor independence, then resume the posture of strategic ambiguity when the stakes are lower for the U.S. The American way of life depends on leading-edge semiconductors manufactured in Taiwan, and we can’t risk China gaining near-total leverage over the entire U.S. economy.

By saying that we will defend Taiwan, the U.S. can strongly deter China from blockading or invading the island in the near term. Meantime, Taiwan should more than double its own military expenditures to a more rational level of 4% to 5% of its gross domestic product, the U.S. should rapidly arm and train Taiwan with Anti-Access/Area Denial weapons while running at least one destroyer warship through the Taiwan Strait each week. The U.S. should also fortify its own homeland defense, which is at present dangerously vulnerable to major conflicts with China. This includes improving nuclear, super electromagnetic pulse, cyber and space defense capabilities.

That some Republicans describe this position as “isolationist” reminds me of when some progressives used to call my antiwoke views “racist.” Neither makes sense, but once a pejorative becomes a tool to dodge substantive debate, the insult starts to sound more like a compliment.

There’s a simple way forward that will drive excellence and diversity of talent among incoming college classes: the College Board should add a physical fitness section to the SAT, instead of just math and reading sections. This could mirror the “Presidential Fitness Test” – consisting of a 1-mile run, pull-ups, sit-ups, shuttle run, etc. – regularly administered across American high schools until the Obama White House disband it. This is a pro-merit solution that rewards diverse talents: it’s a fact that those who perform well on math & reading tests tend to perform more poorly on the 1-mile run, and vice versa. This would also help address a growing mental health crisis in our country: physical fitness correlates directly with lower rates of depression, anxiety, and drug use. This is not formally part of my Presidential platform but it’s a serious proposal to address multiple cultural & health challenges with a single actionable step: most solutions shouldn’t come top-down from government."

To take opportunities in the land of the free. To try and break the shackles of poverty. To withstand the hardships of life and to stand for what is right.” - Harjot S. of Victorville, CA

The damage is incalculable. They could’ve waited until after fighting season, but didn’t. They could have left from the military air base in Bagram instead of the commercial airport in Kabul, but didn’t. The sheer incompetence was staggering, it’s been two years and no one has been held accountable. Not Biden, not Mark Milley, not Lloyd Austin - who will use their failures and the rise of armed jihadists as an excuse to justify our next misadventure in the Middle East. Hold the managerial class & their puppet Joe Biden accountable or else we will repeat our same mistakes again. Mark my words: that’s exactly where we’re headed in Ukraine after some post-Zelensky warlord takes over after Ukraine loses the war armed with countless billions in U.S. military equipment - just like the Taliban is right now."

1092,shellenberger,2023-08-15 18:58:38+00:00,"Facebook Censors Accurate Information Linking Wind Energy To Whale Deaths

Facebook also spreads misinformation by ""https://t.co/NuvsVDtvtc,"" which relies on debunked U.S. government sources

For the last 20 years, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that his social media company is the “digital equivalent of a town square,” committed to factual accuracy, and protecting the natural environment.

But now, Facebook is censoring accurate information about the relationship between industrial wind energy development and the increase in whale deaths off the East Coast.

Yesterday, Facebook and Instagram censored my post linking whale deaths to wind energy off the East Coast of the United States. The censorship came in the form of a “https://t.co/IFNCMsQako” article from March 31, 2023, which relied entirely on U.S. government sources.

The censorship came on the exact same day that Public and Environmental Progress released a new documentary, “Thrown To The Wind,” which proves that the https://t.co/IFNCMsQako article is false.

“Thrown To The Wind” presents powerful new scientific evidence that the wind industry is responsible for the increase in whale deaths and that U.S. government agencies are either covering up the evidence or have failed to do the research that is described in the film.

Facebook last year defended its censorship by saying its “fact-checks” are just “opinion” and thus immune from defamation lawsuits, like the one brought by former ABC News correspondent John Stossel.

But that means that Facebook is spreading disinformation. By “disinformation,” I mean information that the person knows to be false. Facebook knows its “fact checks” are just their “opinion.” Thus, labeling https://t.co/NuvsVDtvtc, which in this case is simply repeating US government misinformation, as a “fact-checker” is disinformation.

And the consequences are serious. According to Facebook, “Each time a fact-checker rates a piece of content as false, Facebook significantly reduces the content’s distribution … We … apply a warning label that links to the fact-checker’s article, disproving the claim.”

Why is that? Why is Facebook censoring accurate information and spreading disinformation? And how can we fight back?"

That’s why I’m for a constitutional amendment to raise the voting age from 18 to 25 but to still allow 18-year-olds to vote if they either pass the same civics test required of immigrants to become naturalized citizens or else to perform 6 months of military or first responder service.

1176,VivekGRamaswamy,2023-08-14 20:08:16+00:00,"Here we go again: another disastrous Trump indictment. It’s downright pathetic that Fulton County publicly posted the indictment on its website even before the grand jury had finished convening. Since the four prosecutions against Trump are using novel & untested legal theories, it’s fair game for him to do the same in defense: immediately file a motion to dismiss for a constitutional due process violation for publicly issuing an indictment before the grand jury had actually signed one. He should make a strong argument on these grounds & it would send a powerful message to the ever-expansive prosecutorial police state. As someone who’s running for President against Trump, I’d volunteer to write the amicus brief to the court myself: prosecutors should not be deciding U.S. presidential elections, and if they’re so overzealous that they commit constitutional violations, then the cases should be thrown out & they should be held accountable."
1177,VivekGRamaswamy,2023-08-14 19:26:47+00:00,"Here's the way forward on election integrity:
1. Single Day Voting
2. Make Election Day a National Holiday
3. Paper Ballots
4. Government-issued voter ID matched to the identification on file.

1178,VivekGRamaswamy,2023-08-14 18:31:07+00:00,"It’s shameful that U.S. taxpayers are literally paying for the salaries of Ukrainian government employees, yet our own citizens in Maui are left to fend for themselves after the fires leveled over 2,200 buildings. Another example of America Last policies at work."
1179,VivekGRamaswamy,2023-08-14 18:01:58+00:00,"The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is fundamentally hostile to nuclear energy in the U.S. and the worst irony of all is that it’s also worse for safety. Together, this is strictly bad for American greatness. Prior to the NRC’s inception, the average approval time for a new nuclear plant was 3-4 years. Today, it’s 25-40 years. By comparison, Japan is still able to build new plants in 3-4 years & it’s 5-8 years for France. Even worse, the cumbersome NRC regulatory burden ensures that the operating nuclear plants in the U.S. don’t use the newer Gen III or Gen IV models, which are safer and more efficient than the older Gen I and Gen II designs that the U.S. uses. By contrast, China is the first country to operate a Gen IV reactor while we’re still stuck in Gen II.

Answer: Shut down the NRC. I’ll get the job done.

The NRC has a staff of ~2,949. 47% of the staff in administrative staff and redundant roles should be laid off immediately. 

The remaining 1,554 specialists will be reassigned to serve within other agencies that have overlapping missions for greater efficiency and better focus.

Reassignments:

- Department of Energy (1,176 specialists)
Office of Nuclear Energy: licensing, oversight, mission support, and training.

- The EPA (317 specialists)
Nuclear materials and waste safety.

- FEMA (43 specialists)
Event response

- DHS (18 specialists)
Homeland security.

This shutdown and reassignment of specialized personnel will return 62% of the NRC’s budget to taxpayers and unshackle nuclear to drive American energy."

1265,historyinmemes,2023-08-11 22:10:26+00:00,"On March 23, 1966, in an accident that is now known as the Palomares incident, a B-52 bomber carrying four hydrogen bombs collided with a refueling tanker in Spain, and one of its nuclear weapons dropped into the sea.

As a U.S. Navy salvage team worked to recover the bomb, the towing line broke, sending a heavy steel pipe shooting toward the team — and in an incredible act of heroism, diver Carl Brashear threw himself in front of his men, taking the pipe in the leg.⁠

Brashear not only survived, but he overcame extraordinary obstacles to get himself recertified as a master diver even though his leg had been removed, making him the first amputee diver in Navy history. Brashear was motivated by his beliefs that ""It's not a sin to get knocked down; it's a sin to stay down"" and ""I ain't going to let nobody steal my dream.""

For his service in helping to retrieve the bomb, Brashear was later awarded the   Navy and Marine Corps Medal, the highest navy award for non-combat heroism."

1267,VivekGRamaswamy,2023-08-11 20:28:33+00:00,It happened. Good. Now let’s see if it’s more than a fig leaf.
1268,VivekGRamaswamy,2023-06-24 15:49:45+00:00,"It’s past time for the FBI and the DOJ to be fully transparent about these political investigations. Today, I am calling for a special counsel to investigate and publish all findings relating to Hunter Biden and Biden-family business dealings. We the People deserve to know.

I am deeply skeptical of special counsels. We should dispense with the charade that a ‘special’ counsel is somehow unbiased or immune from the Administrative State’s corruption. It’s a lose-lose proposition: either the special counsel still reports to the attorney general and is bound by DOJ rules and policies in which case it’s a farce, or else the special counsel is entirely unaccountable which creates an Inspector Javert dilemma. Neither is good.
 
But there cannot be a two-tiered justice system in this country. If there’s a Trump-focused special counsel, there *must* be a Biden-focused special counsel too - to investigate mounting evidence of Biden’s potential criminal violations. Public distrust of the American justice system is at an all-time high, and for good reason. For more than 10 years, there has been an FBI investigation into the alleged bribery of Hunter and Joe Biden from the Ukrainian executive of oligarch-owned Burisma. It’s shameful that we are only now hearing about it, and that Hunter Biden escaped DOJ scrutiny with a fig leaf of a settlement designed to provide air cover for the DOJ just days after it indicted the 45th President."
1269,VivekGRamaswamy,2023-08-11 19:45:30+00:00,"On August 17, at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library in California, I will unveil my comprehensive foreign policy vision, including on Russia, China, Taiwan, India, and other Asian nations: shifting from “liberal hegemony” to the Modern Monroe Doctrine. We will support freezing the current lines of control, reopening economic relations with Russia, & a hard commitment that NATO will not admit Ukraine in return for Russia exiting its military partnership with China, removing nuclear weapons from Kaliningrad, and ending its military presence in the Western Hemisphere — a reverse maneuver of what Nixon accomplished with Mao in 1972.

We will further deter China from annexing Taiwan by shifting from strategic ambiguity to strategic clarity: we will defend until 2029 but not afterward, at which point we will have full semiconductor independence from Taiwan, significantly reduced economic independence on China, stronger relationships with India, Japan, and South Korea, and stronger U.S. homeland defense capabilities to protect against cyber, super-EMP, and nuclear attacks. In the meantime, we will have absolutely *zero* tolerance for any breaches of our homeland or aggression in the Western Hemisphere, including Chinese spy balloons, Chinese spy bases in Cuba, intentional fentanyl poisoning, biological lab leaks, illegal border crossings, or any other encroachments of the U.S. homeland — and will make adversaries pay full-on hell if they do.

This is the way: I will lead our nation forward from “neoconservatism” & “liberal hegemony” toward a secure homeland that protects the tangible interests of its citizens."

It doesn’t have to be this way. We can achieve peace: cease further U.S. support for Ukraine &  negotiate a peace treaty with Russia that achieves a vital U.S. security objective: stop Russia’s growing military alliance with China. This strategy is the mirror-image of President Nixon’s diplomatic maneuver that distanced China from Russia in 1972, except this time Putin is the new Mao. In 2001, Russia and China entered their Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation and in February 2022 Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping announced a more expansive “no-limits partnership.” Collectively, these agreements effectively commit each country to defend the other militarily if either is attacked. The Sino-Russia alliance presents the greatest military risk the U.S. has ever faced. Russia and China together outmatch the U.S. in every area of great power competition: geographic footprint, economic potential, industrial manufacturing might, conventional military power, and nuclear weapons, including super-Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) weapons, which could destroy critical U.S. infrastructure resulting in hundreds of millions of American civilian casualties. My top U.S. national security objective is to disrupt this Sino-Russian alliance in a manner that weakens China without war."
