In a pilot program for guaranteed income in Stockton, California, recipients of unconditional cash were quicker to find full-time employment than control groups.

Looking specifically at the impacts of the expanded CTC, there was no evidence that receiving the benefit reduced work, and economists at Columbia University estimated that making the program permanent would deliver a more than tenfold return on the investment of about $100 billion per year — a major boost to the economy. That means in addition to solidifying the massive drop in child poverty and giving millions of struggling American families continued support to pay for food, school supplies, utilities, and rent, taxpayers would also save money in the long run.""

""Jain Family Institute (JFI), a nonpartisan think tank, found that 40% of Republican state senators voted for fully refundable child tax credits. A September poll by Hart Research and the Economic Security Project found that 60% of Republican voters support a fully refundable CTC.""

A majority of the Senate actually chose to increase child poverty by 139%, mostly due to the shared belief that kids deserve poverty for their parents not earning enough, and despite the fact we spend over a trillion dollars a year on the downstream effects of child poverty that we could spend less on just preventing, and despite the fact that even most voters (even a supermajority of Republican voters) support reducing child poverty with a fully refundable child tax credit.

Congress is broken, and we need to fix it so we can actually function again as a country and pass necessary policies like the monthly CTC and universal basic income and more.

To fix Congress we need democracy reforms like nonpartisan primaries, ranked-choice voting, and multi-member districts for proportional representation. We need to end all gerrymandering.

We need a Congress that responds to the will of voters, so we can directly reduce the poverty, insecurity, and inequality of voters.

280,Theholisticpsyc,2023-09-02 03:31:35+00:00,"THIS IS GOING VIRAL SO I WANTED TO SHARE IT HERE TOO: 

A bit from my past:

My first job after getting my PhD was working as a therapist for people from low socioeconomic backgrounds.

Almost all of them were diagnosed with depression, GAD, bipolar, or BPD. Most were highly medicated— some to a point that still sticks with me years later.

As I got to know their background and lives 3 things were very clear:

1. A vast majority had been emotionally neglected, emotionally abused, or physically abused as children. 

2. A vast majority had experienced domestic violence or were currently living in it.

3. Basic needs were never met. Life was an hour by hour struggle. Treatment was an attempt to allow them to get to work in most cases. To just continue to surviving.

It was the start of me questioning the field I had been trained in. One that diagnoses people with disorders without taking a look at the whole picture. It began my path of holistic understanding. 

A person cannot be well when one unexpected bill will have them fall behind on rent. When they lay their head on a pillow and all they can think about is expenses piling up. When a bill at the grocery store is almost double what they paid last year when their income has stayed the same.

An entire family unit deeply struggles within survival mode. When a job is lost. When daycare needs to be paid, but so does the light bill— what do you choose? When parents can’t even think about the emotional needs of their children because they have to figure out where their next meal is going to come from. 

In 1942, 10 years before the diagnostic manual of mental illness was released Maslow knew what was once just common sense: we have a hierarchy of needs. 

At the bottom are basic needs food and shelter. Then safety (resources, security). Then belonging (connection, friendship, intimacy.) Without three things we *will* be sick, period. 

I get pushback for questioning the status quo. And I’ll continue to do it. The status quo is keeping people sick. It denies their experience. And it says we should bandage people’s symptoms so they can return to the environment that made them sick.

May we wake up, heal ourselves, and build conscious communities to help each other.

Retweet if you feel this is true in your body 🙏"

887,Holden_Culotta,2023-07-15 18:12:21+00:00,"81% of Americans Live In A One-Party State: The reality of America’s two-party system is a one-party system in 39 states. 🏛️

George Washington warned that political parties “serve to organize faction… to put in the place of the delegated will of the nation, the will of a party.”

John Adams warned that “a division of the republic into two great parties” was to be “dreaded as the greatest political evil, under our Constitution.”

Nearly 250 years later, Americans are growing convinced that our legacy two-party system reflects the tribal and inconsistent “projects of faction” which Washington described long ago.

While approx. 40% of US voters are independent, <1% of elected officials in Washington, DC are independent.

This stark imbalance in representation also exists at the state level, yet the majority of state governments are controlled by just one party; not even two.

Unified, one-party control or the governorship and both chambers of the state legislature is known as a “party trifecta.”

Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, the number of states with trifectas fluctuated between 20-25.

In 2010, the Tea Party movement upended that dynamic. The number of states with Republican trifectas more than doubled from 9 to 22.

The shift towards one-party states has proven to be a trend rather than an anomaly.

Following the 2022 midterm elections, a record 39 states are governed by party trifectas.

Americans recognize that a system without legitimate competition is undemocratic, unrepresentative, and prone to an erosion of accountability.

Yet as voters have grown more independent, states have moved to solidify one-party rule.

Gerrymandering, or manipulating the redrawing of electoral districts to give one party an advantage, is one of the most egregious forms of the two parties’ subversion of the democratic process.

Independent and third party candidates, meanwhile, must meet steep requirements just to earn ballot access, then they must contend with enormous fundraising gaps and a plurality voting system that reduces them to “splitting the vote.”

President Washington warned that powerful parties would enable a “small but artful and enterprising minority” to replace “wholesome plans” developed by communities with shallow “projects of faction.”

His words describe many of our states today:

In Florida, Republicans hold 28/40 State Senate seats (70%) and 85/120 State House seats (71%). Meanwhile, just 37% of FL voters are Republicans.

In California, Democrats hold 32/40 State Senate seats (80%) and 62/80 State Assembly seats (78%). Only 47% of CA voters are Democrats.

Candidates are now largely selected in primary elections, which do not always allow independent voters to participate and instead reflect the will of a small group of dedicated Democrats or Republicans.

In 2022, Fix Our House estimated that 90% of US House races took place in “safe” red or blue territory.

It is only natural that such a system becomes warped towards partisanship.

Those who seek a re-invigoration of our storied democracy should build a foundation for a national movement by turning their focus to the state and local level.

The last breakdown of America’s party system occurred during the 1850s, when the abolitionist Republican Party was founded.

Republicans made a concerted effort to win local and state elections in the 1850s, successfully building out the foundation of a national party network and winning offices to advance their agenda at every level within their reach.

The Republican Party was founded in 1854 and won the presidency 6 years later. This was not by chance.

Their achievement stood on the shoulders of years of local and state organizing.

This time, the goal cannot be to replace one party and continue on with a two-party system.

The goal must be a true multi-party democracy which reflects the vast diversity of thought that exists within our Union of 334 million people. 🇺🇸"

Brave people forged this country, and brave people reformed it in the 247 years since 1776. The preservation of our experiment in self-government demands that bravery of us today, just as it has every generation before us."

1055,AndrewYang,2023-07-01 19:14:47+00:00,"RT @So Damian Lillard has finally requested a trade. Spilling some of my thoughts on the situation after @ShamsCharania said Dame specifically wants Miami.

A Heat trade package will realistically include some combination of these pieces:

Miami assets
Heat 2028 and 2030 1sts
Heat 2027 and 2029 swaps
Tyler Herro
Nikola Jovic
Jaime Jaquez rights
Kyle Lowry expiring

That's not much for a superstar that just averaged 32.2 points on 64.5 TS%—both career highs. Brooklyn is the other team Dame expressed interest in. The Nets could easily outbid Miami's best offer:

Brooklyn assets
Nets 2029 1st
Mavs 2029 1st
Suns 2025, 2027, and 2029 1sts
Suns/Nets swap in 2028
Nets swap in 2030
Noah Clowney rights
Dariq Whitehead rights
Day’Ron Sharpe
Cam Thomas
Ben Simmons

The Nets can offer more and still have leftover assets to go make another move, whereas Dame to the Heat would be Miami's final big move.

Dame himself says that's a concern of his, which I noted in my recent @ringer article:

But the Nets with Dame aren't quite on the level of some other teams either. So I think you have to factor in sleeper teams—most notably the Spurs, as @ramonashelburne acknowledged below—who have a ton of future picks:

As @wojespn chimed in, Dame doesn't have a no-trade clause. The Blazers can actually trade him wherever they want to, which is especially noteworthy since Miami's best offer isn't all that great.

The Spurs still have $28M in cap space they could use to sign free agents (Brook Lopez?) and then they have tradable contracts with a large number of future picks to outbid any other team for Dame.

Lillard could end up in Miami at the end of this. But it's worth considering the possibility he ends up elsewhere."
