MichaelBennet,2023-09-21 23:34:57+00:00,"Small businesses in Colorado shouldn’t face more regulations than the most powerful companies in the world. Big Tech no longer gets to go unchecked while hurting our kids and unraveling the social fabric of our country.

MichaelBennet,2023-09-14 20:02:18+00:00,"I couldn't agree more, @CoryBooker. 

Congress let the expanded #ChildTaxCredit expire after one year. And our country's kids are much worse off because of it.

It's time to restore the expanded #ChildTaxCredit to help end child poverty once and for all."
CoryBooker,2023-09-14 17:51:40+00:00,"Two years ago, after intense advocacy from me, Senators @MichaelBennet , @SherrodBrown , and @ReverendWarnock , and a group of allies in the House, Democrats in Congress and @POTUS passed into law under the American Rescue Plan the biggest middle class tax cut in a generation: a one-year expansion of the Child Tax Credit, putting up to $300 per child per month straight into the pockets of more than 90 percent of American families. 

The impact of this tax cut was huge. Families facing rising prices used the tax cut to help pay for gas, groceries, childcare, and medicine. 

And Census Bureau data found that, thanks to this tax cut, the child poverty rate in America was cut in half, to a record low. 

But because Congress was one vote short of renewing the expanded credit, it expired. Now, new Census Bureau data has confirmed the expected and shameful result: child poverty more than doubled in the past year, up almost 140 percent. 

This is a moral obscenity. 

The richest nation in the world shouldn’t tolerate our children living in poverty. And our experience with the Child Tax Credit proves that we don’t have to. Poverty is a policy choice. We can end child poverty if we have the will to do so. 

It’s past time Congress finds the will to renew the expanded Child Tax Credit."
