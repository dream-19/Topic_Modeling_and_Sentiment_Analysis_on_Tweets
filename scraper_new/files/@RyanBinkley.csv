In total, 3.6 million borrowers will have had $127 billion in debt wiped out since Biden took office. Why do college graduates deserve help at the expense of other hard-working taxpayers who have already paid off their debt, or who didn't attend college at all?

President Biden is trying to buy college students’ votes today with everyone’s  financial future. This will lead to higher inflation and a slower job market."

RyanBinkley,2023-09-18 05:08:10+00:00,"We are the UNITED States of America. Every great thing we’ve accomplished as a nation, we’ve done together. United we stand…

But divided – by politics – we fall. Modern politics thrives on division – attacking our opponents instead of debating them – demonizing and scapegoating instead of looking for shared solutions to common problems.

Our political system no longer answers to “We the People” but instead serves the agenda of anonymous corporate donors and political elites.

How do fresh new ideas – and traditional ideals like freedom and unity – break through?

Through caring citizens like you – via national polling.

I have already qualified for the next Republican debate on Sept. 27 in terms of fundraising. Now I only need 3% support at the polls to step onto that stage – which is why I’m asking you this favor…

If a pollster calls you, please say: “I support Ryan Binkley for President.” 

I’m a CEO of a private investment bank with a deep understanding of the financial storm looming over our nation. 

I’m a pastor who knows division, hatred, and discontentment with each other have brought us to a place of brokenness in our culture. 

We need an economic revival and a spiritual revival. The time for that revival is now.
