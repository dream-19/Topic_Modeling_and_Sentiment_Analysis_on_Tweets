134,GOP,2023-09-15 21:54:28+00:00,"It was a disastrous week for Joe Biden.

VIETNAM: Biden began the week with a 30+ minute meltdown in Vietnam, where he took a handful of pre-written questions from pre-selected reporters in a ‚Äúpress conference‚Äù that more closely resembled the ramblings of a madman. Then, he announced he was ‚Äúgoing to bed.‚Äù

9/11: He then returned to the United States, where he became the first president in 22 years to mark the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks not at an attack site. Instead, Biden delivered brief remarks during a refueling stop in Alaska, where he falsely claimed to have visited Ground Zero ‚Äúthe next day‚Äù ‚Äî which didn‚Äôt happen.

IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY: On Tuesday, Speaker Kevin McCarthy directed House committees to begin a formal impeachment inquiry into Biden over allegations of influence peddling, corruption, and abuse of power ‚Äî and Americans largely support it. In fact, 59 percent of Americans are ‚Äúconcerned about whether Joe Biden committed wrongdoing related to his son Hunter Biden‚Äôs business dealings,‚Äù including 65 percent of independents.

BIDENFLATION: On Wednesday, news broke that inflation surged to 3.7 percent year-over-year in August ‚Äî ‚Äúhotter than expected‚Äù and more than twice the rate it was when Biden took office ‚Äî as the Biden administration continues its streak of being wrong on inflation every step of the way.

INDICTMENT: Hunter Biden was indicted on felony gun charges, just weeks after a sweetheart plea deal from Biden‚Äôs DOJ fell apart under basic scrutiny from a federal judge ‚Äî and more charges are likely coming.

BIDENOMICS: On Thursday, Biden attempted to sell his failed ‚ÄúBidenomics‚Äù agenda with a speech in Maryland. Instead, Biden filled the speech with outlandish promises, made-up stories, and casual racism.

KAMALA: Everyone knows Kamala Harris is a liability ‚Äî and this week, the dam apparently broke. Democrat Reps. Nancy Pelosi and Jamie Raskin didn‚Äôt hold back, refusing ‚Äî repeatedly ‚Äî to throw their unwavering support behind Harris.

STRIKE: Biden, who fancies himself the ‚Äúmost pro-union president‚Äù in history, couldn‚Äôt stop the United Auto Workers from striking ‚Äî even though he said it wouldn‚Äôt happen. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what [Biden] has done,‚Äù said one local UAW president.

With weeks like these, is anyone surprised 70 percent of Americans say things are going BADLY under Biden?

No wonder he‚Äôs retreating to Delaware for the weekend ‚Äî again."

Joe Biden‚Äôs VP staff colluded with Hunter‚Äôs business partner on Burisma corruption media response.

@RepJamesComer is calling on the National Archives to provide complete and unredacted documents related to the Office of the Vice President colluding with the Biden family and their business associates.

In one example, on December 4, 2015, Eric Schwerin, a longtime Biden family business associate, wrote to Kate Bedingfield in the Office of the Vice President, providing quotes the White House should use in response to media outreach regarding Hunter Biden‚Äôs role in Burisma.

Later that day, Ms. Bedingfield responded to Mr. Schwerin saying, ‚ÄúVP signed off on this[.]‚Äù

According to Devon Archer, after a Burisma board of directors meeting in Dubai on the evening of December 4, 2015, Hunter Biden ‚Äúcalled D.C.‚Äù to discuss pressure that Burisma asked him to relieve.

In the letter to the U.S. Archivist, Chairman Comer is requesting the documents and information below regarding communications between the Office of the Vice President and Hunter Biden or his business associates.

‚óæÔ∏è Complete and unredacted versions of all documents from Records on Hunter Biden, James Biden, and their Foreign Business Dealings, Case Number 2022-0121-F;

‚óæÔ∏è All documents and communications to or from the Executive Office of the President (including but not limited to the Office of the Vice President) to, from, copying or regarding Eric Schwerin, Devon Archer, Vuk Jeremic, John Robinson ‚ÄúRob‚Äù Walker, or Jeffrey Cooper;

‚óæÔ∏è All documents and communications to or from Kate Bedingfield, Michael Carpenter, Kathy Chung, Amos Hochstein, Colin Kahl, and Alexander Mackler to, from, copying or regarding Hunter Biden or James Biden; and
