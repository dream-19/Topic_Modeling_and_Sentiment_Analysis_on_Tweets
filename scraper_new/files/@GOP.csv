GOP,2023-09-15 21:54:28+00:00,"It was a disastrous week for Joe Biden.

VIETNAM: Biden began the week with a 30+ minute meltdown in Vietnam, where he took a handful of pre-written questions from pre-selected reporters in a ‚Äúpress conference‚Äù that more closely resembled the ramblings of a madman. Then, he announced he was ‚Äúgoing to bed.‚Äù

9/11: He then returned to the United States, where he became the first president in 22 years to mark the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks not at an attack site. Instead, Biden delivered brief remarks during a refueling stop in Alaska, where he falsely claimed to have visited Ground Zero ‚Äúthe next day‚Äù ‚Äî which didn‚Äôt happen.

IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY: On Tuesday, Speaker Kevin McCarthy directed House committees to begin a formal impeachment inquiry into Biden over allegations of influence peddling, corruption, and abuse of power ‚Äî and Americans largely support it. In fact, 59 percent of Americans are ‚Äúconcerned about whether Joe Biden committed wrongdoing related to his son Hunter Biden‚Äôs business dealings,‚Äù including 65 percent of independents.

BIDENFLATION: On Wednesday, news broke that inflation surged to 3.7 percent year-over-year in August ‚Äî ‚Äúhotter than expected‚Äù and more than twice the rate it was when Biden took office ‚Äî as the Biden administration continues its streak of being wrong on inflation every step of the way.

INDICTMENT: Hunter Biden was indicted on felony gun charges, just weeks after a sweetheart plea deal from Biden‚Äôs DOJ fell apart under basic scrutiny from a federal judge ‚Äî and more charges are likely coming.

BIDENOMICS: On Thursday, Biden attempted to sell his failed ‚ÄúBidenomics‚Äù agenda with a speech in Maryland. Instead, Biden filled the speech with outlandish promises, made-up stories, and casual racism.

KAMALA: Everyone knows Kamala Harris is a liability ‚Äî and this week, the dam apparently broke. Democrat Reps. Nancy Pelosi and Jamie Raskin didn‚Äôt hold back, refusing ‚Äî repeatedly ‚Äî to throw their unwavering support behind Harris.

STRIKE: Biden, who fancies himself the ‚Äúmost pro-union president‚Äù in history, couldn‚Äôt stop the United Auto Workers from striking ‚Äî even though he said it wouldn‚Äôt happen. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what [Biden] has done,‚Äù said one local UAW president.

Joe Biden‚Äôs VP staff colluded with Hunter‚Äôs business partner on Burisma corruption media response.

@RepJamesComer is calling on the National Archives to provide complete and unredacted documents related to the Office of the Vice President colluding with the Biden family and their business associates.

In one example, on December 4, 2015, Eric Schwerin, a longtime Biden family business associate, wrote to Kate Bedingfield in the Office of the Vice President, providing quotes the White House should use in response to media outreach regarding Hunter Biden‚Äôs role in Burisma.

Later that day, Ms. Bedingfield responded to Mr. Schwerin saying, ‚ÄúVP signed off on this[.]‚Äù

According to Devon Archer, after a Burisma board of directors meeting in Dubai on the evening of December 4, 2015, Hunter Biden ‚Äúcalled D.C.‚Äù to discuss pressure that Burisma asked him to relieve.

In the letter to the U.S. Archivist, Chairman Comer is requesting the documents and information below regarding communications between the Office of the Vice President and Hunter Biden or his business associates.

‚óæÔ∏è Complete and unredacted versions of all documents from Records on Hunter Biden, James Biden, and their Foreign Business Dealings, Case Number 2022-0121-F;

‚óæÔ∏è All documents and communications to or from the Executive Office of the President (including but not limited to the Office of the Vice President) to, from, copying or regarding Eric Schwerin, Devon Archer, Vuk Jeremic, John Robinson ‚ÄúRob‚Äù Walker, or Jeffrey Cooper;

Otherwise, Harris has been holed up in Los Angeles and D.C. with few, or any, public appearances.

It‚Äôs all part of a pattern of neglect by the Biden-Harris administration.

In reality, Americans have seen the ‚Äúcompassion‚Äù and ‚Äúempathy‚Äù one would expect from the type of man who refused to recognize his own granddaughter for four years. The most recent example? When Biden was asked about the Maui wildfires, the deadliest wildfires in the U.S. in over a century, he smirked and said ‚Äúno comment.‚Äù

This is the ‚Äúempathy‚Äù we have come to expect from Biden:

‚Ä¢ Afghanistan ‚Äì When Kabul fell, Biden was on vacation. When he ended the evacuation and left Americans stranded, he went back on vacation. During the dignified transfer of U.S. servicemembers killed during his withdrawal, he looked at his watch. To this day, he insists he ‚Äúwas right‚Äù and refuses to recognize any mistakes even as new reports indicate that the attack at the Kabul airport could have been prevented.

‚Ä¢ East Palestine, Ohio ‚Äì Biden took weeks to even tweet about the toxic train derailment. Over six months later, he still has not gone to East Palestine even after he promised to go. He has spent weeks on vacation instead.

‚Ä¢ The Border ‚Äì Biden has only spent a few hours at the border during his entire life, in a pre-planned, Potemkin village-style photo op. As cartels increase their ‚Äúoperational control‚Äù of huge swaths of the border, Biden insists his plan is ‚Äúworking‚Äù while his administration calls his cruel policies ‚Äúhumane.‚Äù

‚Ä¢ Fentanyl Crisis ‚Äì Fentanyl, smuggled into the U.S. by Mexican cartels, is poisoning tens of thousands of Americans every year. But how does Biden react? He laughed about a mother who lost her two sons to fentanyl after she told her heartbreaking story to Congress.

‚Ä¢ The Surging Cost Of Living ‚Äì Biden laughed at the millions of Americans who are struggling to afford food, rent, and gas. As credit card debt surges to over $1 trillion and Americans rely on ‚Äúbuy now, pay later‚Äù plans to afford necessities, he smirks, holds absurd victory laps, and claims ‚ÄúBidenomics‚Äù is ‚Äúworking.‚Äù It‚Äôs not.

If they weren‚Äôt so out-of-touch with reality, they would know there‚Äôs a simple reason why ‚Äì his disastrous economic agenda is making Americans poorer.

Here‚Äôs a day in the life of ‚ÄúBidenomics‚Äù for millions of Americans:

‚Ä¢ You wake up and have your cup of coffee, which is 30% more expensive than when Biden took office.

‚Ä¢ You head to work, but filling up your car costs over a $1.40 more per gallon then when Biden took office, and has been above $3 a gallon for over 800 days.

‚Ä¢ It would be nice to go out to eat, but unfortunately, the cost of going out to eat under Biden has skyrocketed 19.3%.

‚Ä¢ When you head to the grocery store, you don‚Äôt get much relief. Under Biden, grocery prices are up 19.3%.

‚Ä¢ Time and time again, you need to rely on your credit card and ‚Äúbuy now, pay later‚Äù apps to make it to the end of the month. Now, your credit card debt is at an all-time high.

‚Ä¢ You‚Äôre forced to take a hardship withdrawal from your 401(k) to make ends meet.

‚Ä¢ You toss and turn falling asleep, struggling to forget that the interest rate on your credit card debt is surging.

This is the ‚ÄúBidenomics‚Äù snake oil Biden is selling. Americans‚Äô opinions of it are clear. Only two percent say the economy is ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù while 78% rate the economy negatively. Only 36% approve of Biden on the economy.

One year later, there‚Äôs a reason just 39 percent of Americans say they support the Bidenflation Scam:

‚Ä¢ It does nothing to solve inflation. Economists say the bill will only ‚Äúadd to price pressures‚Äù and drive higher deficits.

‚Ä¢ It raises taxes, with more than half of the tax burden falling on Americans making less than $200,000/year ‚Äî another broken Biden promise.

‚Ä¢ It targets the poor, with $80 billion for 87,000 new IRS agents at an agency with a record of auditing Americans earning $25,000/year FIVE TIMES MORE than other income groups.

‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs a giveaway to the rich, with tax credits for electric vehicles (using parts made in China) that are nothing more than a giveaway to the wealthy, subsidized by low- and middle-income Americans.

The Bidenflation Scam is a far-left wishlist cloaked under a catchy name; there‚Äôs a reason every Democrat voted for it.

Ultimately, it‚Äôs a choice between believing Biden and your bank account, and Americans are believing their bank account.

In fact, after weeks of the White House pushing ‚ÄúBidenomics,‚Äù what are the top two things voters associate with the term? Inflation and tax increases. With prices up 16.6% and real wages down 3% since Biden took office, their sentiment is backed up by the economic facts.

Americans clearly don‚Äôt trust Biden, and who can blame them? ‚ÄúBidenomics‚Äù is just one of many times Biden has lied to the American people.

‚Ä¢ In April 2021, he said he had ‚Äúgotten control‚Äù of the border. That was a lie.

‚Ä¢ For months, he insisted ‚Äúno one‚Äù was warning about sustained price hikes. That was a lie.

‚Ä¢ He said he ‚Äúwas right‚Äù about his Afghanistan withdrawal. That was a lie.

‚Ä¢ He said his family never made money from business with China. That was a lie.

‚Ä¢ He joined Democrats in smearing Georgia‚Äôs widely-supported voting law, even expressing support for a boycott. That was a lie.

‚Ä¢ He claimed his policies lowered the ‚Äúdebt‚Äù by $1.7 trillion in his first two years. That was a lie.

‚Ä¢ He insisted Republicans wanted to cut veterans‚Äô benefits. That was a lie.

The list goes on and on. And those are just the comments he himself made. There‚Äôs a lot more baseless spin, dodges, and lies coming out of his administration every day.

Here‚Äôs the point: Every time Biden brags about his disastrous record at a ‚ÄúBidenomics‚Äù pit stop, he is not telling the truth. Lying can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt pay the bills. Not only is his record a disaster, he‚Äôs proving that you can‚Äôt trust a word he says.",1135.0

The chaos in Delaware reaffirms two things:

1) The IRS whistleblowers ‚Äì whose stories have never changed ‚Äì are credible and their allegations should be taken seriously.

2) Joe Biden has a lot of explaining to do.

The Biden administration‚Äôs claim today that this is a ‚Äúpersonal matter‚Äù for Hunter does not fly given the ever-growing evidence ‚Äì including text messages, emails, photos, visitor logs, and on-the-record accounts ‚Äì indicating that Joe Biden not only knew about, but was also involved in, his family‚Äôs alleged multi-million dollar influence-peddling scheme.

It also does not fly after Biden‚Äôs repeated lies about Hunter‚Äôs laptop, about whether he spoke with Hunter about business, and about his family‚Äôs dealings with Chinese entities.

This was never just about Hunter, but about Joe Biden.",1219.0
