UN sanctions on 84 individuals & entities related to Iran’s nuclear/military programs are being lifted along with the missile embargo — legalizing Iran developing missiles and providing drones to Russia — both of which Iran is already violating. America must instead turn the screws on the Mullahs.

We must:

(1) impose the most crippling sanctions on Iran and its terror proxies in history — which includes immediately snapping back all of the UN sanctions

(2) cease all engagement including secret negotiations and deals with Iran

(3) stop giving Iran more than $80 billion dollars in lax sanctions enforcement of Iran oil sales

(4) revoke sanction waivers and stop giving Iran access to $6 billion in the terrible ransom payment, $10 billion in Iraq, and $6.7 billion from the IMF

(5) demand our allies fully designate the IRGC and Hezbollah as a foreign terror organization

(6) suspend the security clearance, investigate and hold accountable anyone implicated in the Iran foreign influence operation that has ties to senior Biden Admin officials

""There are very few books in my library that I just have to finish in one sitting and Mr. Levin’s new book is one of them. For the past 40+ years, as a lay preacher, I have been trying to warn congregations about the very issues Mr. Levin so clearly and pointedly sets forth. The very second paragraph reads like the opening of a sermon on Last Day Events. I am excited that Mr. Levin has stepped forward and placed these events before his mass audience in black and white so they can clearly read what has been happening to our great nation.""

marklevinshow,2023-09-22 15:58:36+00:00,"I’m at Union Station in DC waiting for the train. I’m forced to watch CNN. With a government shutdown looming, which actually means the vast majority of the government remains open, the media drumbeat as if these are the end times is sickening. When governors shutdown the private sector and schools and places of worship for months and destroyed businesses, jobs, and lives, CNN and its ilk were all in. They insisted this was a necessary and righteous price to pay for the country. But if the federal government takes a long holiday, as if it’s Christmas time, we’re told the sky is falling. We live in a government-centric time, where the ruling class and its media care only about protecting their own interests and power. It’s also why you hear nothing about the Democrat Party’s scurrilous budget tactics, supported by the McConnell Senate RINOs, which include blowing through the spending caps agreed to in May and doing nothing about the open borders. They get a complete pass. No media discussion about the unsustainable spending and borrowing that the GAO, CBO and OMB have all warned about in no uncertain terms, as fiscal and national security disasters.

That said, the 5 Republicans who refused to support a proposal negotiated by Byron Donalds, including an 8 percent cut in domestic spending (excluding Defense and veterans benefits), and significant border security measures, have done more harm than good. Given what we know about the Democrat Party media, the GOP will be attacked, which is par for the course, but for what? It’s one thing to take a principled stand with a strategy and endgame. It’s another to have a temper tantrum and nothing more. I remember that every time the government was shut down under Reagan, 6 times, it was over a specific policy or program that he wanted funded or defunded, as well as cutting overall spending. There was no confusion about his demands. The 5 are not only all over the map, they cannot accomplish anything. That’s Pickett’s charge."

If shareholders don't like what management is doing, then get rid of them.  But the impact on tens of millions of Americans who earn far less than tens of thousands of the UAW employees will not only drive up the cost of car repairs and cars overall, and cripple supply chains (after all, the purpose of a strike of this magnitude is to create as much disruption as possible), but will further make the lives of tens of millions of hard -working Americans -- waitresses, janitors, painters, and on and on  --  that much worse given the economic dislocation that will occur.  This class warfare crap is a joke in that this strike, should it get worse, will seriously harm average, working Americans all over the country who do not get the kinds of medical and other benefits UAW employees receive.  Furthermore, imagine if all employees were able to demand a 32-hour work week and a 40 percent salary increase, plus significant benefits.  What a disaster!  Yet more inflation and shortages.  Notice, too, how few conservatives, who call themselves populists, are speaking out right now about this.  Where do they stand?  They are utterly unprincipled.

It is the DOJ, headed by Biden political bomb throwers, who Chutkan has thus far served well.  The timing of the trial, outrageous and irresponsible opinions from the bench, discovery issues, etc. -- the evidence is abundant.  Ask yourself this question:  why is DOJ so invested in Chutkan as the judge in this case against Trump?  Another: why did they even file a brief against the Trump motion, which is extraordinary in itself.  Because Chutkan is their judge -- that is, the best pro-Biden, anti-Trump judge to oversee their appalling indictment, and they do not want her handing the case off to a real professional.  AP says Trump's lawyers' request for her to recuse herself is a longshot.  That's exactly the point.  She will try to hold onto this case regardless of her obvious improprieties under the code of judicial ethics.  Of course, the corrupt DOJ and the Democrat Party media run to her defense."

Trump DOJ said Nancy Pelosi and the House Democrat majority could not establish a legitimate impeachment inquiry without a full vote of the House.  So now, we are told, the House GOP should have held a full vote of the House.  First, McCarthy is following the precedent set by Pelosi.  Second, the DOJ does not determine the procedure the House follows (it's called separation of powers).  Third, even if there's not a House majority to vote for an inquiry today, that certainly does not mean there won't be a majority to hold a full impeachment vote down the road, especially depending on how the proceedings play out."

Joe obstructed that investigation.  According to Ken Buck and his new friends in the Democrat Party media, this is not evidence of anything.  Joe Biden spoke to an untold number of Hunter's foreign clients, including top officials with ties to the Communist Party regime in China, but this, according to Ken Buck and his new friends in the Democrat Party, is not evidence of anything.  Hunter took an untold number of trips with Joe on Air Force II where he met with numerous foreign officials in countries and with governments in which Hunter was doing business or wanted to do business.  According to Ken Buck and his new friends in the Democrat Pary, so what?  Joe Biden knew, as a matter of fact, that Hunter was representing officially or even unofficially numerous foreign businesses.  That's more than enough to be required to register under FARA.  Therefore, Joe Biden assisted his son in violating FARA, which does not require a payment of any kind and is not a specific intent crime -- a co-conspirator.  Joe Biden's staff and Hunter's business associates were in constant contact.  I guess they were just buddies.  And there's a ton more.   Of course, for impeachment purposes, you do not require evidence of a crime under the criminal code.  Ken Buck might not know this but there was no federal criminal code when the Constitution was ratified.  Nor is there a requirement of the kind of evidence required to convict in a courtroom, or a ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" standard.

But let's be clear, the list of Joe Biden impeachment issues that I quickly assembled here is far, far more compelling than any information that was brought against Donald Trump. He neither blackmailed the president of the Ukraine (Zelensky said he was not), Biden did; nor did he commit high crimes or misdemeanors on January 6, when there was no House inquiry, just a railroad job by the House Democrats (with support from a mere 10 Republicans), a quick vote, followed by a Stalinist trial (while Trump was a private citizen), in which Trump was found innocent.

As for Kevin McCarthy not taking a vote of the House to initiate an impeachment inquiry, Nancy Pelosi set the precedent for this.  The sword cuts both ways, and in this case it certainly should.  As an aside, Matt Gaetz is whining all the time, this time that McCarthy was too slow or whatever.  Actually, his beef is with Jim Jordan, James Comer, Jason Smith, the three investigative committee chairmen who've specifically said they need time to build a preliminary case before an impeachment inquiry."

marklevinshow,2023-09-06 18:15:57+00:00,"In 1858, Abraham Lincoln challenged Sen. Stephen Douglas to seven 3-hour debates in congressional districts throughout Illinois.  Lincoln was the Republican nominee, Douglas the Democrat nominee for senator.  Even though the state legislature selected the senator, the two candidates agreed it was very important that both present their views, especially about slavery, to the citizens of the state.  Plus, it could have an impact on how the legislature would eventually vote.  The role of the press back then was basically to transcribe what the two men said at each debate and make it available to the general public; they were not moderators of any of the debates.  The debates were public events.  People from all walks of life would attend.  Douglas would win re-election on the vote of the legislature, but it was fairly close.  In 1860, the transcribed debates were published in a book, which Lincoln used, in part, to run for president in 1860.  Lincoln would win barely 40% of the popular vote but won the presidency via the Electoral College. So much for eliminating the Electoral College.  If Lincoln had not won, it's very like the United States would have dissolved.

If debates were conducted this way in America today, where serious candidates with some level of support beyond 5% debate each other for a period of several hours, without interruption by press-directed questions but instead debate rules negotiated and agreed to in advance by the two major parties or even the two or three major/leading candidates, I believe the nation would benefit enormously.

The 1860 election was among the most important, if not the most important, in American history.  The next such election will be 2024.  The issues of secession, slavery, and nullification were all on the table.  Dred Scott had been decided (wrongly) by the Supreme Court just a few years earlier.  Today, the issue of the Constitution and the Republic are also on the table, as the same Democrat Party seeks to replace them with its own ideology and the relentless use of governmental power in ways once thought unimaginable.  From CRT and the war on the nuclear family, to indicting and seeking the imprisonment of the leading Republican running for President as well as others opposed the Democrat Party policies, from protecting the current Democrat President from investigation for widespread criminality, to the Democrat Party regime seeking to destroy the independence of the Supreme Court and alter the voting system to empower itself and disenfranchise tens of millions of voters (mostly Republicans), from eviscerating the Bill of Rights and the nation's sovereign borders, and so much more -- with a Democrat Party press cheering all the way -- the 2024 election will likely determine if we are nation of liberty or tyranny.

Incredibly, there will never be a series of long form debates between the Republican and Democrat nominees for president in 2024 because the eventual Democrat Party nominee is mentally incapable of speaking beyond a few soundbites.  That would've been absolutely unacceptable in 1858.  Back then, the press would've mocked and humiliated Joe Biden, not serve as his stenographers and chief defenders.  But today, we do not have a free press.  We have a press that is free to undermine our country."

OmarRiverosays,2023-09-03 02:18:31+00:00,"BREAKING: ABC News drops bombshell, reveals that “efforts to keep Donald Trump off the 2024 ballot under the 14th Amendment” are “gaining steam” as “election officials in key states are preparing legal challenges to Trump's candidacy.”

But it gets WAY worse for Donald Trump…

ABC reports that “Arizona, Michigan, and New Hampshire” are “gaining momentum” in their quest to keep insurrectionist Trump off the ballot — which would decimate Trump’s chances of winning in 2024.

Adding insult to injury for Trump, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson tells ABC News that “she and other secretaries of state from Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada, New Hampshire and Maine started having conversations over a year ago about preparing for the legal challenges to Trump's candidacy.”

This news comes as legal scholars across America — from both sides of the political aisle — are calling for Trump to be banned due to Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment, which states that an elected official is not eligible to assume public office if that person ""engaged in insurrection or rebellion against.” 

That description fits Trump and his actions like a glove. 

Please retweet and ❤️ if you think that EVERY state must ban insurrectionist Donald Trump from the ballot — and consider joining the growing exodus to Tribel, a woke new Twitter competitor that banned Trump for life and is exploding in popularity because Elon Musk banned Tribel’s Twitter account — but he forgot to ban this link to download the new Tribel app: https://t.co/0c9FDbByU8"

Why isn't there a single Republican member of Congress drafting a new judiciary act that breaks up the cabal of DC radical lawyers, dressed up as judges, who are destroying our judiciary, justice system, and republic?  We must have a new judiciary act that also moves a variety of areas of adjudication out of DC to more neutral parts of the country, where grand juries and trial juries are not populated by individuals who are almost exclusively Democrats.  This is absolutely critical.  I understand it would have to get through the Senate and be signed by the President, but you must begin these battles and push public opinion, as well as try to attach it to every major piece of legislation.  I think it's also worth considering term limiting all federal district judges and circuit judges in DC to 10 years.  They are simply too powerful and too political.  They've demonstrated that they've abused their life-time appointments and have become abusive and even tyrannical."

Instead, he blames Trump for the government's actions, which he has not problem with, and then laments that Trump, in defending his liberty during the course of the campaign, is distracting Republicans and undermining their case against Biden.  This is the kind of unprincipled, gutless politician Republicans should reject.  Putting his race for president over the dismantling of our justice system not by Trump, but by Biden- Garland- Smith is the mark of a pathetic quisling.  He has no clue what is going on in this country, like the other RINOs who are running. And despite all his talk about having beaten a sitting Democrat when he first ran for governor, that sitting Democrat was extremely unpopular due to his raising taxes, numerous ethical issues, and his messy personal life.  Christie left NJ a big mess and couldn't get elected to anything in that state today."

That's why it will be ignored by the Democrat Party media.  That said, Bratt not only met with Biden's staff at the White House while investigating Donald Trump and weeks before Trump was charged, Bratt is the senior DOJ official who insisted on securing a warrant and sending an FBI SWAT team to Mar-a-Lago; and, Bratt stands accused by Stanley Woodward, who represents Walt Nauta in the documents case, of extorting him (Bratt allegedly told Woodward that the judgeship he is seeking has a better chance if his client turns on Trump).  Judge Cannon should order, from the bench, that all records related to Bratt's meetings and discussions at the White House be preserved and provided to the court; and, she should ask the DC judge who has been dragging his feet in his secret review of the allegation against Bratt by Woodward transfer that matter and all the information related to it to her as it clearly bears on the document case that is now before her and in her jurisdiction.  

Yet again, I am forced to ask, where the hell are Trump's lawyers?  They should file a motion immediately seeking a court order for the information (mentioned above) and make a big stink about this outrageous news.  

Let me add another important point. THIS CLEARLY adds to the overwhelming case for a special counsel, as this not only creates the impression of a conflict of interest but a conflict of interest in fact.  The Biden administration cannot be relied on to truthfully explain itself.  The standard for appointing a special counsel -- a qualified lawyer from outside the government -- has been met, again!

https://t.co/7C9lF13R7p"
marklevinshow,2023-08-22 17:37:01+00:00,"It's not particularly useful when NeverTrumpers from the time Trump announced his run for president in 2015 are making declarations to Trump supporters and the GOP base today insisting that they abandon their man for, well, I guess, anyone else since, in this case, Andy McCarthy doesn't tell us.  Respectfully, such a declaration is mostly self-serving.  The fact is that the Democrat Party and NeverTrumpers have done some of the most unthinkable things to cripple the Trump presidency and post-presidency in ways that will permanently damage our republic.  Of course, they tell us, that's mostly Trump's fault.  He brought it on himself.  Since the guy was treated like dirt even before he was elected, that criticism is hard to stomach.  And he was elected by many to take a sledgehammer to the DC ruling class -- that is, to do what others have promised but never accomplished.  But this is not a post about all that.

McCarthy may well be right, but there are candidates running for the GOP nomination who are not named Trump who couldn't get elected dog catcher in their own states, most of whom are establishment Republicans who have no clue how to address what has been and is being done to our country -- namely, a literal revolution by one party against the other party and the country -- and were weak and largely ineffective in their prior political positions.  And several could get clobbered in a general election for many reasons, including if they cannot attract the vote of MAGA voters and other conservatives.  The numbers simply won't add up.  The likes of Larry Hogan, Asa Hutchison, Lisa Murkowski, and Chris Christie (in his own way) have every intention of abandoning the GOP should Trump be nominated.  (Bill Barr is prepared to jump off a bridge, which could be fatal given his likely lack of buoyancy.)

That said, conservatives of all types, not just MAGA supporters, are rightly fed up with the likes of Mitch McConnell, the longest serving Senate leader ever, who doesn't lift a finger to elect conservatives like Cruz, Lee, Johnson, et al, but spends millions from his special interest funded PAC to elect Murkowski, Collins, et al.  This defines the entire GOP Senate leadership.  McConnell has done nothing to help expose the Biden family corruption and publicly tells the House GOP (which cannot stand him) not to open an impeachment inquiry, while giving a long interview to Politico about how he is sabotaging Trump.  But he is fiercely defended by the DC Republicans and their media and think-tank surrogates for doing a handful of things, especially related to judges, that any Senate GOP leader (especially a conservative) would have done.  They've had enough of the lingering political operatives, like Karl Rove and others, who couldn't even back Ronald Reagan in 1976 and in the 1980 GOP primary (incidentally, McConnell backed Ford over Reagan in 1976, as did my friend Hugh Hewitt).

Chris Christie is the most despised of all GOP candidates by all Republicans.  He receives a tremendous amount of free media on all news platforms, despite the fact he cannot win a general election without significant Republican support.  In my view, he would lose a general election in a landslide.  And I could go down the list.

I could also go on about this general subject, and no doubt will have to given what will be the utterly predictable responses from the usual GOP voices and establishment-backing commentariat.  That said, McCarthy is a very good legal analyst, with whom I sometimes disagree, but the rest of this is the usual stuff.  And if Trump gets the nomination and loses the general, he and others can pat themselves on the back and say ""I told you so.""  But they've told us nothing.  Perhaps any GOP nominee would lose or would win; hard to tell right now.  It is not ""very simple."" And the ""I told you so"" crowd never remind us when they've told us when they've been dead wrong.  Nobody really gives a damn anyway.

By the way, my unsolicited advice: YOU are running for and want to be president.  YOU think you are the best suited to be president.  PROVE IT!  The media will have its own agenda -- Trump, abortion, Biden impeachment, etc.  Be prepared for it.  Someone like Christie is there to attack and bully.  Be ready to dismiss him.  Others are slick talkers.  Politely pin them down -- blank slates make for poor presidents.  Show some charisma, have a personality, address the American people and try to connect with what they are experiencing, point to your accomplishments, and most of all, IMHO, demonstrate that you know the nation is unraveling and you intend to do serious things about it.  FWIW."
AndrewCMcCarthy,2023-08-21 03:01:15+00:00,"Very simple: Trump can’t win. 65% already against him. That’s before Dems launch barrage after getting him nominated. If we finally grasp that, his support will collapse. If not, we lose everything, and Dems use majorities to remake Supreme Court. Nominate him if you want, but that’s reality."

Furthermore, the person handling personnel early in the Trump administration was a former top advisor to John Boehner, a major mistake.  Personnel is, as they say, policy.  Weiss is a Biden hack, which is beyond obvious."

It is a message that is never heard in big media, which represents the ruling class in Washington, New York, and LA.  But it is time to take sides if we are ever going to pull out of this.  We are being devoured by a Democrat Party/American Marxist revolution that is chewing up our culture and economy and destroying our republic.  It is creating the very circumstances Oliver is singing and talking about -- in our classrooms, at the kitchen table, in the job market, etc.  The only way we can ever hope to overcome this, if we can, is to be very clear about what is happening to our country, who is responsible, and who stands for tyranny and who stands for liberty. Indeed, the left is trashing Oliver's song because they reject his background and his message.  Their goal is to destroy the country, not unity, etc.  That's what revolutions are all about.  https://t.co/nx7B6iz8O2"

marklevinshow,2023-08-18 22:03:04+00:00,"Israel does stand on its own two feet. It spends around 8 percent of its GDP on defense. And it has fought bravely for 75 years in numerous wars and battles. Your statement is absurd. Nonetheless, it’s a tiny country with few people. It’s enemies not only receive billions in weapons from our enemies, but in the case of Iran billions from our country via Biden’s policies.

However, you miss the point entirely. Israel is an ally in a very dangerous part of the world. We need Israel as a counterweight to Iran, Syria, terrorist organizations, etc. You seem oblivious to America’s need to have strong and reliable allies throughout the world to help our own security needs. Foreign policy should be based on prudence not flip ideological comments. You’re not ensuring our security you’re ensuring we will need a much larger military, many more service personnel, bigger intelligence operations, more ships and aircraft, etc., if we do as you suggest. Our allies benefit from our support, but we benefit from them being our first line of defense in certain parts of the world. Your position is not well considered. Happy to discuss further with you on my radio show after next week’s debate, although it’s always tough to get you on.

Moreover, you can’t just say you’re going to create more Abraham Accords and then walk away. First, nobody will enter into a new accord if we take your position. Why would they? You just going to sweet talk them into it?  Our role there is what created the accords, as President Trump understood.  Second, the Abraham Accords actually expand our role in the Middle East. China, Russia and Iran would salivate if we did as you say. Yet, you say you support them.

You’ve essentially said the same about Taiwan. Somehow Taiwan will help us build a computer chip industry then we abandon them. That’s nonsensical. Nor is it in our best interests. From Goldwater to Trump, no serious Republican or conservative has believed as you do. I fear your foreign policy is more in line with Bernie Sanders or the late George McGovern.  Maybe even the Squad I also believe it’s much more likely to cause a world war as China and others see appeasement and weakness and great opportunities.

 I’m all for outsiders. But, respectfully, you need to bone up a bit on this subject. It’s not about forever wars, which have nothing to do with this, or new thinking. It’s old and failed and provocative thinking. Nothing novel or smart about it. IMHO.

God bless."

If we can lead the way in helping Israel fully integrate into the economic and security infrastructure of the Middle East via Abraham Accords 2.0, it is better for everyone if Israel is truly able to stand on its own feet with support from partners across the Middle East that we diplomatically bring to the table.

marklevinshow,2023-08-16 23:32:46+00:00,"Respectfully, Jonathan Turley is simply wrong.

The Constitution is silent on whether you can indict a sitting president or whether a president can pardon himself, even for federal offenses.  I challenge Jonathan to demonstrate otherwise.  Moreover, the argument that a president cannot be indicted is based on practicality and rationality, nothing more and nothing less.  That is the position of the Justice Department under attorneys' general of both parties -- first in a 1973 memorandum by the Office of Legal Counsel (under the Nixon administration), and subsequently endorsed by a second memorandum by OLC in 2000 (under the Clinton administration).  The position taken is that you cannot have the executive branch decapitated or crippled by a president who is having to spend an enormous amount of time defending his freedom; that we cannot have an elected president who is convicted running the executive branch from prison; and, of course, the impact on foreign policy and national security could be disastrous.

The idea, as Jonathan seems to argue, without any constitutional bases (his reference to federalism in this context is utterly irrelevant), does not address the problems raised by the DOJ decades ago.  This has nothing to do with the general pardon power where a president does not reach into state affairs and pardon individuals for charges and convictions based on state law violations.  This involves a sitting president, elected by the voters to serve as president, who serves at the top of the executive branch.  The rational argument must be that local and state prosecutors have no more ability to decapitate or cripple the federal executive branch and a president than do federal prosecutors, under the argument set forth by DOJ.  Although they don't address state charges, the reasons a president can pardon himself when faced with federal indictments are exactly the same when it comes to state charges.  And it is those reasons that the DOJ has taken the position is has.  In fact, since there are literally thousands of local and state prosecutors, the argument is even more compelling when applied to non-federal prosecutors. Can one imagine the mayhem that would result from local or state prosecutors free to act as Jonathan suggests they can?  This is among the reasons why the actions in NY and Georgia by local Democrat DAs are so disastrous to the nation, apart from the abuse of grand juries and the law.

There is nothing novel about what I am saying, any more than it is novel to argue that a president can pardon himself from federal indictments.  As I said, the Constitution does not address the indictment or pardon issue in that context.  Nonetheless, I take into account what the official DOJ position has been for over half a century respecting the impact an indictment would have on the ability of a president to defend himself and run the country.  I agree with that view.  But it is not based on some hidden language in the Constitution.  It is based on practical consequences.  Jonathan's view is not based on the Constitution.  Nor is his reference to the history of the pardon power and federalism.  They are literally irrelevant.  I contend that Jonathan's view, when you really think about it, is or at least would be the outlier.  But since no president has been in a position to have pardoned himself, the issue is who has the better argument not whether one position or another is novel.  And the reason we are here is because the Biden DOJ and Democrat DAs have brought us here. https://t.co/sFADMrSskH"

marklevinshow,2023-08-15 23:22:25+00:00,"President Trump can, in fact, pardon himself from the GA charges if he is elected president.

1. The Constitution's silent about whether a president can be indicted.
2. The DOJ has taken the position under both parties that you cannot indict a sitting president because it would cripple the executive branch and make his ability to defend himself effectively impossible.
3. Given the DOJ's position, and the Supremacy Clause in the Constitution, I would argue strongly that the idea that a president cannot be indicted at the federal level because it would cripple the executive branch, but can be indicted by local DAs, would have exactly the same effect as a federal indictment, except there are thousands of local and state prosecutors making the crippling of a president even more likely.
4. FURTHERMORE, if indicted and even convicted, the idea that a president cannot pardon himself from state charges is absurd, again, not only because of the Supremacy Clause, but the same considerations that apply to a federal conviction would obviously apply to a state conviction.

Therefore, I disagree with Jonathan Turley's view and others who keep repeating it."

Barr's discussion about the latest indictments supposedly involving Jan. 6 is incoherent and imbecilic.  In other words, he has nothing but contempt for Trump because Trump fired him, and he would be thrilled if Trump not only lost the election but was sentenced to years in prison.  That's why he is on his own egomaniacal public tour, doing press everywhere and anywhere trashing the former president and, mostly, giving aid and comfort to Garland and Smith.  Mike Pence is another piece of work.  He took notes in his discussion with the president about the election for the purpose of covering his ass one day, even though a president is free to ask his vice president to delay the counting of electors (whether or not that's a good idea is beside the point, it is not unconstitutional or illegal).  Pence first fought the grand jury subpoena.  After he was forced to testify and provide his notes (which he took in secret), now he tries to position himself as some great hero.  He fooled no one and destroyed his reputation.  Both of them are now in great demand by news organizations because they serve the purposes of DOJ and the Democrat Party media.  Disgraceful."

There will be no executive privilege, since Biden and Chutkin have already denied it to Trump.  Moreover, every DOJ/FBI official involved in interfering in this election, with dozens of indictments, venue violations, attorney-client privilege denials, and the rest, must be investigated for any possible crimes they may have committed.  There needs to be a complete and comprehensive search of all data files, including if necessary, home searches for any government documents, etc., witness testimony before a grand jury (no need to use a grand jury in DC, as Garland-Smith have shown us, pick a grand jury in West Virginia.)  These bastards must understand that they've unleashed a monster, and that monster will be unleashed on them.  Then, perhaps, this will never happen again.

Thus far, Chris Christie has said he would not support Trump.  Mike Pence has not yet answered.  BOTH SHOULD BE DISQUALIFIED.  The rules should not be changed to accommodate the campaigns of two candidates who cannot break the 1 percent support level -- but no candidate should be able to participate in the debate unless they meet all the stated requirements."

She's not up to the job, she is not a fair and unbiased judge, and she is interfering in the election -- just by the way she has already handled the protective order filing by the DOJ Democrat/Stalinists.  When the GOP takes the presidency, hopefully next election, there needs to be a complete shakeup of the federal judiciary in DC, which is nothing more than a Democrat Party operation, including removing certain areas of subject-matter jurisdiction (Congress can do this in coordination with the president), increasing the number judges so conservatives can start packing some of these courts (just as Obama-Reid packed the DC Circuit by adding judges), and a complete overhaul of DOJ and the FBI.  Given how Biden has used executive orders, there's no reason a Republican president cannot do much of this via executive orders.  These corrupt institutions must be busted up or the GOP will cease to be a serious, effective political party, and the Democrat Party will succeed in monopolizing government and elections -- and the U.S. will become a one-party country like all autocracies and states like California, etc.  This revolution, which is destroying our republic, must be confronted and if it is not, kiss your country goodbye."

By her willing if not interested participation in the election through the courtroom (I will note, 3-Obama appointed federal judges sat in the back row of the courtroom during the magistrate's hearing last week, when Trump appeared in person), the judge has exposed the entire judicial system to scrutiny and even ridicule.  Of course, Smith and his Stalinists wish to gag Trump during the election.  If the judge tries such a move, she should be condemned.  Moreover, if Trump violates her gag rule, will she throw him in federal prison?  This is a dangerous game and the judge should reject it all."
marklevinshow,2023-08-07 22:38:07+00:00,"I talked about grand jury abuse on radio, Fox, and LevinTV a few weeks ago, as one of the motion's the Trump lawyers should've filed a few weeks ago, but they did not.  Now, the judge is taking it upon herself to ask about it.  The DOJ guidelines for prosecutors are as clear as can be -- grand jury investigations are to occur in the district where the relevant events are alleged to have taken place.  You can't look for grand juries in districts where you think are most beneficial to the government, and then move the case to the relevant jurisdiction claiming superseding indictments or whatever.  The grand jury in Florida did not actually hear from the witnesses or participate in the investigation.  This DOJ rule exists for a very important reason, and Jack Smith, yet again, cut corners in a way that should result in the dismissal of the entire case.

In DC, Smith, again, cut off discussions about Trump's access to information that is to be used in a trial, using the absurd claim that his social media post was grounds for withholding the information from him.  Not only is that ridiculous, but Smith files his protective order Friday night, gets a hearing Monday, after cutting off the discussions with Trump's lawyers about his demand that Trump now have access to key information.  This is the same Smith who succeeded with another Obama judge in violation Trump's attorney-client privilege due process rights in the documents case in from the same grand jury that should not have even been involved in the documents case (see above).  

The fact that our legal system allows this kind of an unethical, rogue lawyer use the resources and power of the government to violate the basic norms of criminal law practice, and that DC judges go along with this and have for years, is a disgrace to the Bar and the legal profession."

1. On April 2, 2022, Biden aides selectively leaked to The New York Times that Biden was frustrated with Garland for not indicting Trump:

""The attorney general’s deliberative approach has come to frustrate Democratic allies of the White House and, at times, President Biden himself. As recently as late last year, Mr. Biden confided to his inner circle that he believed former President Donald J. Trump was a threat to democracy and should be prosecuted, according to two people familiar with his comments. And while the president has never communicated his frustrations directly to Mr. Garland, he has said privately that he wanted Mr. Garland to act less like a ponderous judge and more like a prosecutor who is willing to take decisive action over the events of Jan. 6.""

https://t.co/Lz84FBiTui

2. On April 11, 2022, Jonathan Su, deputy White House counsel to President Biden, relayed to the National Archives that Biden waived Trump's claim of Executive Privilege, leading to the unprecedented raid on a former president last August and the June indictment by Garland and his special counsel Jack Smith for the non-crime of a former president having his presidential records--which Trump's allowed to have under the Presidential Records Act.

https://t.co/BTPWkL06uh

3. On November 9, 2022, Biden said this:

""Well, we just have to demonstrate that he will not take power by — if we — if he does run.  I’m making sure he, under legitimate efforts of our Constitution, does not become the next President again.""

https://t.co/wwMOTdl2EA

4. On November 18, 2022, Garland appointed disgraced former federal prosecutor Jack Smith, who was unanimously reversed and rebuked by the Supreme Court for his political prosecution of a likely 2016 Republican presidential contender, to pursue Biden's leading presidential rival.

https://t.co/f95nwdJ05C

5. Garland personally approved both of Jack Smith's unprecedented indictments of Trump, for the non-crimes of:

   (a) a former president having his presidential records, which is allowed by the Presidential Records Act; and

   (b) a presidential candidate objecting to the presidential election, which is allowed by the Electoral Count Act of 1887 and the First Amendment.

But, besides that . . ."

marklevinshow,2023-08-04 17:46:06+00:00,"How to get the matter before the Supreme Court?

Perhaps the way forward is for President Trump's attorneys in the Florida document case to appeal the lower court's ruling for a trial start date in May to the circuit court making, in part, the arguments I discussed on air last night and below on this site.  Make an emergency appeal to the circuit court, since what's being raised is the government's efforts in using the courts and the judicial process as tools to deny Trump his constitutional right to effectively defend himself and his freedom, and conduct his campaign for president at the same time.  He is unable to do both effectively at the same time. The government is interfering with both and doing so knowingly.

These cases can be pursued after the election, as there is no statute of limitations issue (recall, Garland purposefully let a statute of limitations run in the Hunter Biden tax case; here, there is no running of statutes of limitations if the cases are put off until after the election.  Hard to see how DOJ can square any argument they'd make in opposition).  The Biden administration is knowingly forcing this issue by the manner in which it is litigating for the purpose of creating these extraordinary and unprecedented circumstances.  Garland, who has signed off on every indictment brought against Trump in the federal cases, should not be able to deny anyone their constitutional right to due process and an effective defense; nor should he be able to interfere this way in the ability of a candidate for president to conduct his campaign, by the manner, date, and time in which he decides to bring these indictments.  Garland must not be free to control court procedures like he is currently doing.  Garland is playing the system and the judges ought not put up with it.  The activist judges, of course, such as the DC judge, are undoubtedly happy to play along.

The fact is that Trump cannot effectively defend himself and run for president at the same time.  He ought not be forced to decide between one or the other, either.  Meanwhile, every day that goes by effects the election.  His campaign funds are having to be used to defend against these politically timed indictments, and his time campaigning undoubtedly been limited due to the time needed to confer with his lawyers and make court appearances.  This was all predictable when Garland unleashed these cases and timed them for maximum damage to Trump personally and his campaign.  The legal and judicial systems must not allow themselves to be used this way.  In short, the judiciary must also defend itself from such devious manipulations.

I have no faith in any of the judges in DC.  They have lost our respect.  Too many are political activists who have rubber stamped everything the DOJ and Garland-Smith have sought.  I have greater faith in the court in Florida.  Regardless, individual district court judges ought not decide for the nation how we shall now proceed, given what the Biden DOJ has foisted in the nation.  This matter needs to get to SCOTUS.  Hopefully, an appeal from the May court date will do it.  It's not a slam dunk and the ultimate outcome isn't either.  But something must be done."

marklevinshow,2023-08-04 01:43:59+00:00,"Should Donald Trump get elected, he should pardon himself from everything Biden-Garland-Smith are throwing at him during the course of this campaign.  Moreover, although I have concurred with those who argue that a president cannot pardon himself respecting non-federal charges, under the circumstances, I am having second thoughts about this.  Trump should assert the supremacy clause to pardon himself from state and local prosecutors' charges or any convictions launched against him during the course of this federal campaign.  This is all new territory.  But Trump is not required to accept what is being done to him by the Democrat Party."
marklevinshow,2023-08-04 00:21:52+00:00,"MY PUBLIC ADVICE TO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LEGAL TEAM ...
The Biden administration has created a legal morass never seen or experienced in American history, as applies to a presidential election.  The attorney general, appointed by the Democrat president, is authorizing indictment after indictment of his president's possible if not likely political opponent in the middle of a presidential election cycle.  He is doing so through his appointment of a special counsel, whose appointment was a misapplication of the special counsel regulation, and whose charges must be approved by the attorney general.  (By the way, as an important side issue, Jack Smith is not a presidential appointee; he never even stood for confirmation by the Senate to hold the position he holds and to exercise the authority he is exercising against a party opponent.)  It should be noted at the same time, the attorney general refuses to appoint an outside special counsel to investigate his client, Joe Biden, despite the fact that the DOJ regulation was originally instituted for these exact circumstances.  Of course, this underscores the purpose and motive of what is taking place before us today.

The attorney general is approving the timing of dozens of charges against the former Republican president, who is actively seeking his party's nomination to challenge the Democrat president for whom he directly reports, which are intended to cripple the ability of Donald Trump to effectively run for president, regardless of what polls show today.  And regardless of what the commentariat say, and despite President Trump's strength within the Republican Party, the outcome of the election is unknown.  Therefore, the polls are irrelevant in this regard.  Moreover, as further evidence that these indictments are being used as political weapons are the timing of the charges -- specifically, all of these charges by the separate grand juries, all controlled by the special counsel, should have been filed AFTER the election, as there was no possibility the statute of limitations would run on any of them.  Further, the special counsel repeatedly insists that the charges must be quickly adjudicated, meaning before the people vote, for the purpose of having maximum influence on the election.

In addition, the charges have resulted in the significant depletion of Trump's campaign funds to pay for millions in legal fees.  Trump has to take significant time from campaigning to address the dozens of charges dropped on him by the Biden administration -- that is, he has to expend an enormous amount of time working with his lawyers in order to defend himself from charges that, collectively, would result in his imprisonment until his death.

The fact is that this kind of legal warfare against a presidential and possible if not likely opponent to the present president, is not only unprecedented in the history of our republic it will destroy our electoral system for all time.  It is not something that should left to various district courts or local courts to sort out in the course of regular judicial proceedings.  In fact, that is part of the intended strategy by the prosecutors who are engaged in this assault on our electoral system.  They must not be rewarded for their behavior. They must not be rewarded for their treachery and exploitation of the legal system and the courts to achieve their political ends.

Even without getting to the merits of these multitude of charges, which are easily unraveled from my perspective, the process is what is being used to interfere with the election.  And the near silence by those who are orchestrating this shocking legal warfare, when the American people are left in the dark, is untenable.

Therefore, I want to publicly encourage the Trump legal team to seek an emergency hearing before the U.S. Supreme Court, not to resolve legal disputes, but to at least temporarily halt the abomination of this legal warfare that is unfolding in front of us -- where Democrats and anti-Trump Republicans are unashamedly celebrating the use of the courts by the Biden administration and Democrat DA's to further their political wishes, as the rest of the nation watches in shock.  This unprecedented legal warfare requires an unprecedented response by the only constitutional body left that can do something about it -- the Supreme Court."

This unit explores the transformation of African Americans in the U. S. as they transition from enslaved persons to freedmen in the post Antebellum period and the creation of new opportunities and communities.  Each lesson emphasizes different perspectives and experiences of African Americans throughout the process.  Lessons explore the institution of slavery, identify the roles of enslaved people and their acquisition of skills; and examine texts written and read by African Americans such as Frederick Douglass.

Lesson Two – A House Slave: Acquiring Skills:
Students analyze objects to determine what skills a house slave needed to complete assigned tasks.  Students explore the potential marketability of these skills. This lesson also introduces students into 19th century foodways. https://t.co/XNqLMvQY61"

willscharf,2023-07-27 00:35:20+00:00,"Based on conversations with people who were in the courtroom today, and my experience as a former federal prosecutor, I think I know the full story of what happened with the Hunter Biden plea agreement blow-up this morning. 

Bear with me, because this is a little complicated:

Typically, if the Government is offering to a defendant that it will either drop charges or decline to bring new charges in return for the defendant's guilty plea, the plea is structured under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(A).  An agreement not to prosecute Hunter for FARA violations or other crimes in return for his pleading guilty to the tax misdemeanors, for example, would usually be a (c)(1)(A) plea.  This is open, transparent, subject to judicial approval, etc.

In Hunter's case, according to what folks in the courtroom have told me, Hunter's plea was structured under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(B), which is usually just a plea in return for a joint sentencing recommendation only, and contained no information on its face about other potential charges, and contained no clear agreement by DOJ to forego prosecution of other charges.

Instead, DOJ and Hunter's lawyers effectively hid that part of the agreement in what was publicly described as a pretrial diversion agreement relating to a § 922(g)(3) gun charge against Hunter for being a drug user in possession of a firearm.

That pretrial diversion agreement as written was actually MUCH broader than just the gun charge. If Hunter were to complete probation, the pretrial diversion agreement prevented DOJ from ever bringing charges against Hunter for any crimes relating to the offense conduct discussed in the plea agreement, which was purposely written to include his foreign influence peddling operations in China and elsewhere.

So they put the facts in the plea agreement, but put their non-prosecution agreement in the pretrial diversion agreement, effectively hiding the full scope of what DOJ was offering and Hunter was obtaining through these proceedings.  Hunter's upside from this deal was vast immunity from further prosecution if he finished a couple years of probation, and the public wouldn't be any the wiser because none of this was clearly stated on the face of the plea agreement, as would normally be the case.

Judge Noreika smelled a rat. She understood that the lawyers were trying to paint her into a corner and hide the ball. Instead, she backed DOJ and Hunter's lawyers into a corner by pulling all the details out into the open and then indicating that she wasn't going to approve a deal as broad as what she had discovered.  

DOJ, attempting to save face and save its case, then stated on the record that the investigation into Hunter was ongoing and that Hunter remained susceptible to prosecution under FARA. Hunter's lawyers exploded. They clearly believed that FARA was covered under the deal, because as written, the pretrial diversion agreement language was broad enough to cover it. They blew up the deal, Hunter pled not guilty, and that's the current state of play.

And so here we are. Hunter's lawyers and DOJ are going to go off and try to pull together a new set of agreements, likely narrower, to satisfy Judge Noreika. Fortunately, I doubt if FARA or any charges related to Hunter's foreign influence peddling will be included, which leaves open the possibility of further investigations leading to further prosecutions."
marklevinshow,2023-07-27 01:07:29+00:00,"STOP ALLOWING BIDEN HACKS IN AND OUT OF THE MEDIA LIE ABOUT IMMIGRATION

The Biden administration has been pushing foreigners to go to ports of entry and, in turn, they have legalized their entry into the country in enormous numbers.  They have also violated the parole rules to release illegal aliens into the country be untold hundreds of thousands.  WE KNOW THIS AS A FACT.  So, the numbers are not down.  The Biden administration has illegally abused lawful entry into our country to legalized unlawful entry into our country."

marklevinshow,2023-07-26 23:59:56+00:00,"THE SOUND OF FREEDOM

In 21 years on radio, I have never missed a radio show to watch a movie.  Last night, my wife urged me to join her and special viewing of THE SOUND OF FREEDOM on Capitol Hill.  Speaker McCarthy invited members of both parties to the special event.  Not a single Democrat congressman attended.  Not one.  We watched this movie, and it will shake you up.  It will open your eyes.  It will expose the extent of child sex-trafficking not just throughout the globe, but especially in our country.  And the open-borders policies of the regime have handed the borders over to the drug cartels, mobster kingpins, kidnappers, and sex-traffickers.  Indeed, the level of children sex-trafficking has skyrocketed in the last few years. The Democrats and their media have dismissed the movie as Q-Non (sp?) inspired (whatever the hell that is or means).  Why would they not want this horror known to the public and help eliminate it?  Because their politics and policies are dead wrong, and they're destroying and killing people.  The sex-trafficking even involves infants.

I strongly encourage you to watch the movie, as soon as possible.  It is the story of a DHS investigator who rejected the government's red-tape and obstacles to tracking down a brother and sister who were kidnapped and sold into sex. https://t.co/wqVvBL74qN"
marklevinshow,2023-07-26 23:47:47+00:00,"This is what Biden and those who support open borders are responsible for.  And the degree of sex-trafficking, especially children, is horrendous and a direct consequence of Democrat Party policies.    You, too, media, that have done virtually no report on the subject (except for one reporter at the NYT, who did an outstanding job, but we've heard nothing since).

marklevinshow,2023-07-26 23:43:23+00:00,"As we discussed on radio at length, the Hunter Biden deal was an effort to coverup, then censor, then kill any investigation into Joe Biden.  The question is, when will Merrick Garland and the other Obama-Biden Marxists who run the DOJ be directly exposed and held to account.  These mob lawyers are destroying the country.  The deal never made sense -- to anyone.  It was a brazen mob deal, and our noses were rubbed in it -- despite the best efforts of the corrupt Democrat Party to run interference, yet again.  

The deal called for no jail time for tax evasion on perjury on a gun application form.  Plus, immunity from all other outstanding criminal conduct.  The DOJ also let the statute of limitations run on tax fraud committed by Hunter in 2014 and 2015.  MEANWHILE, DOJ said that the investigation was ongoing, thereby attempting to prevent any effort by Congress to look into any aspect of the investigation and the deal.  The judge asked what was still being investigated?  The prosecutors reluctantly said FARA when the judge herself brought it up. But the deal immunizes Hunter from FARA charges or any other charges.  

The individuals at DOJ responsible for this must be held to account.  The level and extent of corruption here is incredible.  I have no doubt the White House is involved.  Certainly, the Democrat Party media and Democrat Party will support all of this and more.  This is what we are up against.  The Democrat Party Hates America."
