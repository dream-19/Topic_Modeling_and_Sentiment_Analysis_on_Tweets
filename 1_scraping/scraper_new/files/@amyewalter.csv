DrJillStein,2023-10-05 19:23:18+00:00,"BREAKING - Stein & Baraka wish Dr. West well, affirm support for a strong Green campaign

Boston - Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka, previously advisors to the West campaign, today wished Cornel West well in his upcoming independent presidential campaign, in the following joint statement:

“As colleagues who helped persuade Dr. West to pursue the Green nomination, we appreciate the good faith effort he has made over the past four months. Running solo, however, may better suit his long standing role as a fiercely independent voice of moral authority. While we share Dr. West’s formidable commitment to peace and justice, we are respectfully parting ways at this juncture, as we are committed to building an independent people-powered party as an indispensable vehicle for challenging empire and oligarchy for the long haul.

“In light of Dr. West’s decision to run independently, we are in discussion with several former candidates about potentially entering the race to carry the Green Party’s anti-war, pro-worker, climate emergency agenda into this critical election.

“With the Democratic Party now leading the charge for war and censorship, betraying workers on the rail strike and dropping the $15 dollar minimum wage, outdoing Trump in new fossil fuel projects on public lands, and voluntarily resuming crushing student debt payments when people are barely scraping by paycheck to paycheck – for all these reasons and more, we need an independent, corporate-free people's party more than ever.

“In deciding to run as an independent, the West campaign leaves behind the ballot lines they would have had access to, as well as the guidance of experienced ballot access staff and Green volunteers familiar with the process in most of the 50 states. We expect this will be a formidable obstacle in the coming months.

“Though Dr. West won’t be running with our team, he is offering an inspired, courageous example to voters and candidates alike. We believe he is making an immeasurable contribution to the 2024 election, and for that we are deeply grateful. Given our similar visions and agendas, we will continue to look for synergy on the road ahead.”"

Do you know how many times I've seen a headline like this 16 months ahead of the actual election? Too many to count.

Of course people would ""consider"" a 3rd choice. That means zip. In the end ~90-95% or more will vote for the D or the R.

That doesn't mean even a tiny vote for a 3rd party won't determine who wins (D or R). But let's not add fuel to the 3rd party push with exaggeration. https://t.co/DKDXUigIvj"
