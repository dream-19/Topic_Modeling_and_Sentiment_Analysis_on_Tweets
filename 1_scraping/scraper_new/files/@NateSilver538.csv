As LA County DA, Cooley had been in office since 2010, received millions of votes vs. 100K for Harris as SF DA. Cooley outspent Harris. Candidate with largest base, more money, higher state wide name ID should have won against obscure SF DA. He lost."

-Ran for AG in Ca. against LA DA Steve Cooley, strongest Republican not named Schwarzenegger in twenty years. Cooley outspent Harris by almost a $1m. Very tight race. Took 3 weeks for winner to be declared. Harris won.

NateSilver538,2023-07-27 21:29:36+00:00,"Below is a long post re: the evolution of the Proximal Origin authors' thought process. They very explicitly never ruled out a lab leak in their private communications, including even *after the paper was published*, even if they believed that natural origin was *also* plausible."
NateSilver538,2023-07-27 21:25:36+00:00,"They convinced themselves, under a lot of political pressure to find in favor of natural origin, that a natural origin was plausible (Andersen was initially skeptical that it was even plausible, saying a lab leak was ""so friggin' likely""). 

But they never unconvinced themselves that a lab leak was plausible, too. Even in the messages people cite as exculpatory (see example below), Andersen and other authors are very clear that a lab leak also remained plausible. (""It does not rule out lab passage"". ""None of this disproves accidental lab infection""). 

https://t.co/lE3LHSN1i5

Their initial draft of the paper was ""merely"" misleading, trying to privilege the natural origin hypothesis more than the authors privately believed, but leaving a little bit of daylight for lab leak. Nature Medicine asked them to remove that ambiguity and they did, to the point that the final paper unambiguously contradicted the private beliefs of at least some of the authors including the lead author (Andersen).

Andersen also said a lab leak was plausible in April, after the paper had been published."

It's worth noting, though, that many extended closures in blue cities affected institutions that are indeed highly valued by blue America: the performing arts, libraries, etc. That's what was so especially confounding about the closures."
NateSilver538,2023-03-07 01:33:08+00:00,"If we zoom back to spring 2020, the most salient fact is that it's an election year, and people making public health decisions are mostly progressive Democrats (public health is very left-leaning). So ""do opposite of Trump"" is the most powerful heuristic."
NateSilver538,2023-03-07 01:33:08+00:00,COVID decision-making is happening under very high stress and uncertainty. The right decisions aren't at all obvious.

NateSilver538,2022-10-28 16:38:04+00:00,"There's not any one simple reason for the gap, it's a few different things that add up. Also not mentioned in the story: Dems will likely perform worse in the *House popular vote* than on the generic ballot because there are a bunch of districts where there's no D on the ballot."
NateSilver538,2022-10-28 16:38:05+00:00,"Rs have a few of these districts too, but Ds have more, and in more competitive districts. This is worth around 1.0 to 1.5 points in popular vote margin for Rs, e.g. an 0.5-point R lead on the generic ballot would translate to a ~2 point pop vote win *even if polls are unbiased*."

It's also a small sample and House races are fluky so doesn't move the topline outlook so much. But NYT has a bad habit of deciding on the narrative *before* doing the reporting and got caught red-handed here.

The Main Vibe is a fairly narrow subset of Twitter, in fact."
NateSilver538,2022-10-27 19:06:01+00:00,"So I'm skeptical of predictions of Twitter's demise so long as those curation tools remain strong. In fact, @elonmusk could make the platform more pluralistic by getting rid of the stupid fucking Trending Topics module, for instance."
